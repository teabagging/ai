For negative integer, two’s complement method is used.Note:All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.Example 1:Input:26Output:\\"1a\\"Example 2:Input:-1Output:\\"ffffffff\\"","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to write a Python function called toHex that converts an integer to its hexadecimal representation. The catch is that I can't use any built-in functions that directly convert the number to hex. Also, for negative numbers, I have to use the two's complement method. Hmm.Let me start by recalling how hexadecimal works. Hexadecimal is base 16, so each digit represents 4 bits. The digits go from 0 to 9 and then a to f. Oh right, and for negative numbers, two's complement is used. So for example, -1 in 32-bit two's complement would be all ones, which translates to 'ffffffff' in hex.Wait, the problem says the input is a 32-bit signed integer. So I need to handle numbers from -2^31 to 2^31-1. For negative numbers, the two's complement is calculated by inverting the bits and adding 1, but since Python handles integers with arbitrary precision, maybe there's a way to handle the 32-bit constraint here.First, I should handle the case when num is 0. Then the output is simply '0'.For positive numbers, how do I convert them to hex without using built-in functions? Well, the standard way is to repeatedly divide by 16 and get the remainder each time. The remainders correspond to the hex digits. But the order is reversed, so we need to collect them and reverse at the end.But wait, for negative numbers, I can't just do the same. Because two's complement of a negative number is what's needed here. So maybe I can first convert the negative number to its two's complement 32-bit representation, then process those bits as a positive number.Alternatively, for negative numbers, I can add 2^32 to them to get their corresponding positive value in two's complement. Because in two's complement, a negative number is represented as the complement plus 1. For example, for a 32-bit number, the two's complement of -1 is (2^32 - 1), which is 0xffffffff. So if the input num is negative, maybe I can compute num += 232 to get the equivalent positive value, and then proceed as usual.Yes, that makes sense. Because 32-bit two's complement numbers are modulo 2^32. So for any negative number, adding 2^32 will give the correct positive value that, when represented in 32 bits, is the two's complement of the original number. Then, converting that to hex will give the correct string.So the steps are:1. If num is 0, return '0'.2. If num is negative, add 2^32 to it to get the two's complement value.3. For the resulting number (positive after adjustment for negatives), convert it to hexadecimal by dividing by 16 and getting remainders, then mapping those remainders to hex digits.4. Remove leading zeros and return the string.Wait, but leading zeros are to be stripped except when the number is zero. So even after conversion, if the hex string starts with zeros (like '0001a'), we need to remove them until the first non-zero digit. But since we are processing the number by taking remainders, which gives the digits in reverse order, maybe the collection of digits would start from the least significant digit. So when building the hex string, the digits are added in reverse order, and leading zeros would be at the end of the list. Wait, let me think.Let's take the example of 26. 26 divided by 16 is 1 with remainder 10 (which is 'a'), then 1 divided by 16 is 0 with remainder 1. So the remainders collected are [10, 1]. Then, reversing gives [1, 10], which becomes '1a'.So in the code, after collecting the remainders, we reverse them and then map to characters. So leading zeros would be the zeros that come after reversing. For example, if the number is 10, the remainders would be 10 (a) and 0. Then reversed, it's [0, 10], which would be '0a' but that's not right. Wait, no, 10 is 0xa. Wait, 10 in decimal is 0xA. Wait, 10 in hex is 'a', but 10 is the remainder when you divide 10 by 16. Wait, no, 10 divided by 16 is 0 with a remainder of 10. So the remainders are [10], then the reversed is [10], so the result is 'a'.Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the process. Let's take another example. Let's say num is 32. Divided by 16: 32/16 = 2 rem 0. Then 2/16 = 0 rem 2. So the remainders are [0, 2]. Reverse them to get [2, 0], which would be '20'. But that's correct, 32 is 0x20.Wait, but 32 is 2*16 +0, so yes. So the process works.So the steps for the conversion would be:- Initialize a list to hold the digits.- If the adjusted number is 0, add a '0'?Wait no. Because if the adjusted number is zero (like original num was zero), then the code returns '0'. Otherwise, for non-zero numbers, we process as follows:We loop while the number is greater than zero.In each iteration:- Get the remainder when divided by 16. That's the current digit.- Append the remainder to the list.- Divide the number by 16 (integer division).Once the loop ends, reverse the list of digits, and map each to the corresponding hex character.Wait, but in the example of 26:Loop steps:num = 2626 // 16 is 1, remainder 10. So digit is 10 -> 'a'.num becomes 1.1 // 16 is 0, remainder 1. digit is 1 -> '1'.num becomes 0, loop ends.Digits list is [10, 1]. Reverse to [1,10] -> '1' and 'a' → '1a'.Yes, correct.So, the algorithm for positive numbers (after handling two's complement for negatives) is:digits = []while num > 0:    remainder = num % 16    digits.append(remainder)    num = num // 16digits reversed and mapped to hex.But what if the number is zero? We need to return '0'.So, putting it all together:First, handle the case where num is zero. Return '0'.Else, if num is negative, add 2^32 to it. Because for a 32-bit two's complement, negative numbers are represented as their value modulo 2^32. So adding 2^32 gives the equivalent positive value.Then, process the number (whether adjusted or original positive) as follows:digits = []while num > 0:    remainder = num % 16    digits.append(remainder)    num = num // 16Then reverse the digits to get the correct order.Now, map each digit to its hex character. For 0-9, it's '0'-'9', for 10-15, 'a'-'f'.But wait, the remainders can be from 0 to 15. So for each remainder, we can use a lookup table.For example:hex_digits = '0123456789abcdef'So, remainder 10 → 'a', etc.So, for each digit in reversed digits, we take hex_digits[digit].But the digits list is in reversed order. Wait, no. Wait, the digits are collected as [remainder0, remainder1, ...], which correspond to the least significant digit first. So when reversed, they are in the correct order (most significant first).For example, 26: remainders are 10, 1 → reversed [1,10] → '1a'.So after reversing, the digits are in the order of most significant to least significant.So, the code steps are:- if num is 0: return '0'- else:   if num < 0:      num += 232   digits = []   while num > 0:      rem = num % 16      digits.append(rem)      num = num // 16   hex_str = ''.join([hex_digits[d] for d in reversed(digits)])   return hex_strBut wait, what if the digits list is empty after the loop? That can't happen because if num is zero, we returned early. Otherwise, the loop runs until num is zero, but since num was positive (after adjustment), and initially non-zero, the loop will add at least one digit.Testing example 1: 26 → adjusted is 26. digits collected as 10, 1. reversed → [1,10]. hex_str is '1a'.Example 2: -1 → adjusted to 2^32 -1 → 4294967295. Now process this number.4294967295 divided by 16: let's see. 4294967295 /16 = 268435455.9375 → integer division is 268435455. remainder is 15 (0xf). So digits.append(15). Then num becomes 268435455.268435455 /16 = 16777215.9375 → integer division is 16777215. remainder 15. digits.append(15). This repeats until all digits are 15. How many times?Wait 4294967295 is (2^32 -1) which is 0xffffffff. So when we divide by 16, each step will have remainder 15, and the quotient will be 0xffffffff // 16 = (0xffffffff - 15)/16 = (0xfffffff0) /16 = 0xffffff (which is 16^7-1). So each division by 16 reduces the number by 4 bits, leading to 8 f's.So after processing, digits will have eight 15s. Reversed gives the same list, so the hex_str is 'ffffffff', which matches example 2.Another example: 0 → return '0'.Another example: 15 → rem 15 → digits [15], reversed → [15] → 'f'.Another example: 16 → 16 /16 = 1 rem 0 → digits [0, 1]. Reversed → [1,0] → '10'.So that's correct.Now, handling leading zeros. For example, let's say the adjusted number is 255, which is 0xff. So after processing, digits would be [15, 15], reversed → [15,15] → 'ff'. No leading zeros here.Wait, but leading zeros in the hex string. The problem states that the result should not have leading zeros. So if during the processing, the digits list after reversal starts with zeros, those should be stripped.Wait, but in the code as written, for the case where the adjusted number is 0, we return '0'. For other cases, the digits are processed only when num is positive and non-zero. So the digits list will have at least one element, and after reversal, the first element is non-zero. So leading zeros should not be present.Wait, let's see. Suppose the adjusted num is 15. Then digits is [15], reversed is [15] → 'f'. No leading zeros.If adjusted num is 256 → 256 /16 =16, rem 0 → digits.append(0). Then 16 /16=1, rem 0 → append 0. Then 1/16=0, rem 1 → append 1. So digits are [0,0,1]. Reversed → [1,0,0] → '100' which is correct (256 is 0x100). No leading zeros.But wait, in that case, the first digit is 1, then 0, then 0. So no leading zeros. So the code works.What about a number that would have leading zeros after reversal? Like, suppose adjusted num is 0x0a0 (which is 160 in decimal). Let's see:160 divided by 16: 160 /16 =10, rem 0. digits [0]. Then 10 /16 =0 rem 10 → digits [0,10]. Reversed → [10,0] → 'a0'. Which is correct, no leading zeros.So the code does not generate leading zeros because the digits are collected from the least significant to most, and when reversed, the most significant digit comes first, which is non-zero. Because the loop only runs while num>0. So each step reduces num, but once it's divided down to zero, the loop stops. So the digits list is non-empty, and the first digit after reversal is the most significant digit, which can't be zero. Because if the most significant digit were zero, that would mean that the original number was of the form 0x0...0 (with leading zero digits), but in that case, the division would have stopped earlier. Wait, maybe not. Let's see.Wait, consider a number like 16, which is 0x10. Processing:16 //16 =1, rem 0. digits [0]. Then 1//16=0, rem 1. digits [0,1]. Reversed becomes [1,0] → '10'. The first digit is 1, which is non-zero.But what if a number has leading zeros in higher digits? For example, 0x0001. That's 1, which would be processed as rem 1, num becomes 0. digits [1]. reversed [1] → '1'. Correct.So the code as written will not generate leading zeros because each step is processing the number until it becomes zero, and the digits are added in the order of least to most significant, but when reversed, the first digit is the most significant, which is non-zero. Because the code only appends digits when the remaining num is positive. So for example, if the adjusted number is 0x0abc, the processing would be abc in digits, but since the code starts with the adjusted number (which is non-zero), the digits would be added until num is zero, which would include all necessary digits. So leading zeros in higher digits are not present.So the code should handle leading zeros correctly.Now, what about the case where the adjusted number is zero? That's only possible if the original num was zero, which is handled by the first condition. So that's covered.So the code should work.Now, let's code this.First, check if num is zero. Then return '0'.Else, if num is negative, add 2^32.Then, process as described.Implementing in Python:The hex_digits can be a string '0123456789abcdef'.So the code would look like:def toHex(self, num: int) -> str:    if num == 0:        return '0'    hex_digits = '0123456789abcdef'    if num < 0:        num += 232    digits = []    while num > 0:        rem = num % 16        digits.append(rem)        num = num // 16    # Reverse the digits and convert to hex characters    return ''.join(hex_digits[d] for d in reversed(digits))Wait, but let's test for some cases.Test case 1: input 26. Output should be '1a'.In code:num is 26, positive. So:digits = []loop:rem =26 %16 =10 → digits [10]num=26//16=1.loop continues:rem =1%16=1 → digits [10,1]num=0.digits reversed is [1,10], converted to '1' and 'a' → '1a'. Correct.Test case 2: input -1 → adjusted to 4294967295.Then, process:digits = []num=4294967295.loop:rem =4294967295 %16 → 4294967295 /16 is 268435455 *16 = 4294967280. 4294967295-4294967280=15 → rem=15 → digits.append(15).num =4294967295 //16 = 268435455.Then:rem =268435455%16 → same as (268435455 mod 16). Let's see, 16*16777215=268435440. 268435455-268435440=15 → rem=15. digits [15,15]. num becomes 16777215.This repeats 6 more times. Each time, rem is 15, and num is divided by 16. Finally, when num is 0 after 8 steps. So digits list has 8 elements of 15. Reversed (still 8 15s) → 'ffffffff'. Correct.Another test: num = 0 → returns '0'.Another test: num=255 → 0xff. digits after processing: 15, 15. reversed → 'ff'.Another test: num=16 → 0x10. digits are 0,1 → reversed [1,0] → '10'.Yes, this seems to work.So the code should be correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to convert a given integer to its hexadecimal representation.

The problem says to use the divide and conquer approach. Hmm, how does divide and conquer work here?Wait, I remember that the divide and conquer strategy usually splits the problem into smaller subproblems, solves them, and then combines the results. For this problem, maybe I can split the array into left and right halves, find the max subarray in each, and then check if there's a subarray that crosses the midpoint which could have a higher sum.Right. So for each recursive call, the function will divide the array into left and right parts. The maximum sum could be in the left, the right, or crossing the middle. So I need to compute all three and take the maximum of them.Let's think about the base case. If the array has only one element, the max subarray is that element itself. So when the start and end indices are the same, return that value.Now, for the cross sum. How do I compute the maximum subarray that crosses the midpoint? Let's say the midpoint is at index mid. The cross subarray must start somewhere in the left of mid and end somewhere in the right. So I can compute the maximum sum starting from mid and moving left, then the maximum sum starting from mid+1 and moving right. Adding these two gives the maximum cross sum.Wait, right. For example, take the left half. Starting from mid, we go leftwards, adding each element and keeping track of the maximum sum. Similarly for the right half, starting from mid+1 and moving right. The cross sum is the sum of these two maximums.So here's the plan for the cross sum:1. Find the maximum sum starting from mid and going left (including mid).2. Find the maximum sum starting from mid+1 and going right (including mid+1).3. Add these two sums to get the cross sum.Once I have the left max, right max, and cross max, the overall max is the maximum of these three.So the steps are:- Divide the array into left and right.- Recursively find the max in left and right.- Compute the cross max.- Return the maximum of the three.But how do I implement this in Python? Let's outline the function.The function will be called maxSubArray, which takes nums as input. But since it's a method in a class, maybe the helper function needs the start and end indices. So perhaps create a helper function that takes start and end parameters.Wait, the divide and conquer approach is O(n log n), which is worse than the O(n) Kadane's algorithm, but the problem asks for it as a follow-up.So, the helper function could be something like this:def helper(start, end):    if start == end:        return nums[start]    mid = (start + end) // 2    left_max = helper(start, mid)    right_max = helper(mid+1, end)    cross_max = find_cross_max(start, mid, end)    return max(left_max, right_max, cross_max)Then, the find_cross_max function would compute the cross sum.Implementing find_cross_max:def find_cross_max(start, mid, end):    # Left part (start to mid)    left_sum = 0    max_left = -infinity    for i in range(mid, start-1, -1):        left_sum += nums[i]        if left_sum > max_left:            max_left = left_sum    # Right part (mid+1 to end)    right_sum = 0    max_right = -infinity    for i in range(mid+1, end+1):        right_sum += nums[i]        if right_sum > max_right:            max_right = right_sum    return max_left + max_rightBut wait, what if all numbers are negative? Then the maximum would be the largest single element. The algorithm should handle that because when all are negative, the helper function would return the maximum of left, right, cross. But in the cross case, adding two negative numbers would be worse than each individual. So the maximum would correctly be the single element.Testing the example:Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]The helper function would split into left and right. Let's see:The array has 9 elements. Mid is at index 4 (0-based). Left is from 0-4, right 5-8.Left part: helper(0,4). Then split again. Let's see when it gets to the base case. But perhaps in this case, the cross sum might be found in the left, right, or cross.But in the example, the maximum subarray is [4,-1,2,1], sum 6. Let's see if the algorithm would find it.When the array is split at mid (index 4, value -1), the cross sum would look left from mid (4) to start (0) and right from mid+1 (5) to end (8). Wait, but in this case, mid is 4. So the left part for cross sum is from 4 to start (0). Wait, no, the cross sum starts at mid and moves left, but perhaps the maximum subarray crossing the mid would be the sum of left_part (starting at mid and going left, taking the maximum possible) plus the right_part (starting at mid+1 and going right, maximum possible).In the example, when the cross sum is calculated for the entire array's mid (index 4), the left part would be 4 (since starting at index 4, which is -1, but when moving left to index 4, sum is -1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, in the example array:Indices: 0: -2, 1:1, 2:-3, 3:4, 4:-1, 5:2, 6:1, 7:-5, 8:4.The first split is mid at (0+8)//2 = 4. So the left part is 0-4, right part 5-8.The cross sum would be the maximum subarray that includes elements from the left and right parts. So the cross sum would start in the left (0-4) and end in the right (5-8). Wait, but how?Wait, the cross sum is the maximum sum of a subarray that must cross the midpoint. So the left part of the cross sum is the maximum sum of a subarray ending at mid (index 4), and the right part is the maximum sum starting at mid+1 (index 5). Then the cross sum is left_part + right_part.But how to compute left_part and right_part?Let me recompute the cross sum for the example. The mid is index 4. So the left part (from mid to start):We start at index 4 (value -1), sum is -1. Then move left to index 3 (4), sum is -1 +4=3. Then index 2 (-3): sum 0. index 1 (1): sum 1. index 0 (-2): sum -1. The maximum left_part here is 3 (from index 3 to 4). Then the right part (mid+1 to end). Start at 5 (2), sum 2. then 6 (1): sum 3. then 7 (-5): sum -2. then 8 (4): sum 2. So the maximum right_part is 3 (from 5 to 6). So cross sum is 3 +3 =6, which matches the example.Yes. So the algorithm would find this cross sum, and then compare it with the left max and right max. If the left max is for the left half (0-4), which would have a maximum of 4 (the subarray [4], since for example, the left half is [-2,1,-3,4,-1], the maximum subarray is [1,-3,4] sum 2, or [4], which is 4). Wait, maybe in the left half, the maximum is 4.Then the right half (5-8) is [2,1,-5,4], which maximum subarray is [2,1] sum 3. So the cross sum is 6, which is the maximum.So the algorithm returns 6.So the code seems to work for this example.Now, coding this in Python. The helper function needs to work with indices. Also, the original function needs to call the helper with start=0 and end=len(nums)-1.But what about edge cases? Like when the array has all negative numbers. For example, nums = [-3, -2, -1], the maximum subarray is -1. The algorithm should return that.Another case: empty array? But the problem states that the array contains at least one number.Now, the code.First, the helper function. But in Python, the list is passed as a parameter, but the helper function would need to access the nums array. So perhaps the helper is a nested function inside the maxSubArray method.Wait, the method is part of a class. So the code would look like this:class Solution:    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        def helper(start, end):            if start == end:                return nums[start]            mid = (start + end) // 2            left_max = helper(start, mid)            right_max = helper(mid + 1, end)                        # Calculate cross_max            # Left part from mid to start            left_sum = 0            max_left = -inf            for i in range(mid, start - 1, -1):                left_sum += nums[i]                if left_sum > max_left:                    max_left = left_sum            # Right part from mid+1 to end            right_sum = 0            max_right = -inf            for i in range(mid + 1, end + 1):                right_sum += nums[i]                if right_sum > max_right:                    max_right = right_sum            cross_max = max_left + max_right            return max(left_max, right_max, cross_max)                return helper(0, len(nums) - 1)Wait, but in Python, the infinity is float('-inf'). Also, the nums is a list. So the helper function is called with start and end indices.But what if the array is empty? But the problem states that the array contains at least one element.Testing this code with the example: len(nums) is 9, indices 0-8. The helper(0,8) will compute left_max (0-4), right_max (5-8), cross_max (sum of left_part from 4 to 0 and right_part from 5 to 8).But in the example, the cross_max is 6, which is correct.Another test case: nums = [1], returns 1.Another test case: nums = [-2, -3, -1], the helper would split into left and right. The cross_max would be the sum of left_part (mid=1, left part is [-2, -3], the left part of cross would start at 1 (mid), which is -3, then moving left to 0 (-2), sum -5. The right part is mid+1=2, which is -1. So cross_max is -3 + (-1) = -4. The left_max is max of left part (split again into 0 and 1), but eventually returns -2. Right_max is -1. So the max is -1, which is correct.So this code should work.But in Python, the List is from typing, so make sure to import List from typing.Also, the code may have to handle cases where the array has only two elements. Let's see. For example, nums = [1, -2]. The helper splits into left (0-0: 1) and right (1-1: -2). cross_max is left_part (1) + right_part (-2) = -1. So the max is max(1, -2, -1) which is 1. That's correct.Another example: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]. The maximum is the whole array sum 23. Let's see how the code handles it. The helper splits into left (0-2), right (3-4). Left max would be max of left (0-2: 5+4-1=8), right (3-4:7+8=15). cross_max would be left_part from mid (2) which is -1, moving left: -1 +4 =3, plus 5 gives 8. So left_part is 8. Right_part is 7+8=15. cross_max is 8+15=23. So the max is 23. Correct.So the code seems correct.But what about when the maximum is in the left part, not crossing?For example, nums = [2, -1, 3]. The maximum is 2 + (-1) +3 =4. But if we split into left (0-1) and right (2). The left_max is max(2, -1, 2-1=1) which is 2. The right_max is 3. The cross_max would be left_part from 1 (mid) moving left to 0: sum is -1 +2=1. Right_part is 3. So cross_max is 1+3=4. So the overall max is 4. Correct.Thus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem using the divide and conquer approach, we need to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum by recursively splitting the array into smaller subarrays, solving each subproblem, and combining the results.

Let's think about the problem. So, a power of two would be numbers like 1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 4 (2^2), 8, 16, etc. The input could be any integer, including zero or negative numbers. Wait, but wait, the examples given are all positive. Oh right, because powers of two are positive. So the first thing I need to check is if n is positive. Because if n is zero or negative, it can't be a power of two.So the first condition is that n must be greater than zero. If n is zero or negative, return False immediately.Now, for positive n, how to check if it's a power of two. Let's think about the binary representation. Powers of two in binary are represented as a 1 followed by zeros. For example, 2 is 10, 4 is 100, 8 is 1000. So for a number to be a power of two, it must have exactly one '1' bit in its binary form.How can I check that there's exactly one '1' bit? Well, there's a bit manipulation trick for that. If n is a power of two, then n & (n-1) should be zero. Let's see why. For example, take 8 (1000). n-1 is 7 (0111). 1000 & 0111 is 0000. For a number that's not a power of two, like 6 (110), n-1 is 101. 110 & 101 is 100, which is not zero. But wait, what about zero? Oh, but we already checked that n is positive, so n can't be zero here. So the condition would be, if n is positive and (n & (n-1)) == 0, then it's a power of two.But wait, what about n=1? Let's see. 1 in binary is 1. n-1 is 0. 1 & 0 is 0. So yes, returns true, which is correct. So this method works for all cases where n is a positive power of two.So the steps are:Check if n <=0: return False.Else, compute n & (n-1). If the result is 0, return True. Else, return False.Let me test this logic with some examples.Example 1: Input 1. Since 1>0, compute 1 &0 =0. Return True. Correct.Example 2: 16. 16 & 15 is 0. Return True. Correct.Example 3: 218. Let's see. 218 is even, but divide by 2 multiple times. 218/2=109, which is odd. So not a power of two. The bitwise check would be 218 in binary is 11011010. 217 is 11011001. AND gives 11011000, which is not zero. So returns False. Correct.What about n=0? Return False. Correct.Another test case: n=3. 3 in binary is 11. 3-1=2 (10). 11 &10 = 10. Not zero. So returns False. Correct.Edge case: n=2. 2>0. 2&1=0. Returns True. Correct.So this logic seems solid.So the function can be written as:def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:    return n > 0 and (n & (n -1)) ==0Wait, that's all? Yes. Because for n to be a power of two, it must be positive, and the bitwise check ensures there's exactly one '1' bit.Another way to think: For numbers that are powers of two, their binary has exactly one '1' bit. So the bitwise AND of n and n-1 will clear that bit, resulting in zero.Yes. So this should handle all cases.But wait, what about n=1? 1-1 is 0. 1 &0 is 0. So returns True. Correct.What about n=0? The first condition is n>0, so returns False. Correct.So this function should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given integer is a power of two. A number is considered a power of two if it can be expressed as (2^k) where (k) is a non-negative integer.  ApproachThe key insight to solve this problem efficiently lies in understanding the binary representation of numbers. A number that is a power of two has exactly one '1' bit in its binary form. For example, 2 is represented as \`10\`, 4 as \`100\`, 8 as \`1000\`, and so on. To check if a number has exactly one '1' bit, we can use a bitwise operation. Specifically, for a number (n) that is a power of two, the operation (n & (n - 1)) will result in zero. This is because subtracting 1 from such a number flips all the bits after the single '1' bit, making the bitwise AND operation zero. Additionally, we must ensure that the number is positive since powers of two are always positive.

Check Positivity: The first condition (n > 0) ensures that the number is positive. Negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of two.2. Bitwise Check: The second condition ((n & (n - 1)) == 0) checks if the number has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation. If this condition is true, the number is a power of two.This approach efficiently determines if a number is a power of two with a time complexity of (O(1)) and constant space complexity, making it optimal for this problem."},{"problem":"Given a column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.For example:    A -> 1    B -> 2    C -> 3    ...    Z -> 26    AA -> 27    AB -> 28     ...Example 1:Input: \\"A\\"Output: 1Example 2:Input: \\"AB\\"Output: 28Example 3:Input: \\"ZY\\"Output: 701","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a column title like in Excel, I have to return the corresponding column number. Let's think about how this works.Hmm, right, in Excel columns, each letter represents a digit in a base-26 system. But wait, there's a catch here. Because regular base-26 would have digits from 0 to 25, but here A is 1, Z is 26. So it's like a base-26 number system but without a zero. So each position is 26 raised to the power of the position's index, multiplied by the value of the letter, and then sum all those up.For example, let's take \\"AB\\". The first character is 'A' which is 1. Since it's the first character from the right (if we consider the string in reverse), but wait, no. Wait, in \\"AB\\", the leftmost character is 'A', which is the higher digit. So 'A' is in the 26^1 place, and 'B' is 26^0. So 1*26 + 2*1 = 28. That matches the example.So the approach is to process each character in the string, convert each to its corresponding value (A=1, B=2, etc.), then multiply by 26^position, where the position increases as we move from right to left. Wait, no. Wait, for a string of length n, the leftmost character is multiplied by 26^(n-1), then next by 26^(n-2), etc., down to 26^0 for the rightmost.Alternatively, we can process each character from left to right, and for each step, multiply the current result by 26 before adding the new value. For example, for \\"AB\\":Start with result = 0.First character 'A': result = 0 * 26 + 1 = 1.Second character 'B': result = 1 *26 + 2 = 28.That's a more efficient way, because you don't have to compute exponents. So this is similar to how you process numbers in a string digit by digit. So for each character in the string, we take the current result, multiply by 26, add the value of the current character.Yes, that makes sense. So the algorithm is:Initialize result to 0.For each character in the string s:    result = result * 26 + (char_value)where char_value is the position of the character in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).So how do we get the char_value? Well, in Python, we can use the ord() function. For example, ord('A') is 65. So for a character c, its value is ord(c) - ord('A') + 1. Because 'A' should be 1, so 65 -65 +1 =1. 'B' is 66-65 +1=2. That works.So putting it all together, the steps are:Loop through each character in the input string s:For each character, compute its numerical value.Update the result by result = result *26 + value.Start with result 0, then process each character left to right.So for \\"ZY\\":Z is 26, Y is 25.Processing Z first: 0 *26 +26 =26.Then Y: 26 *26 +25 = 676 +25 =701. Which matches the example.Yes, that works.So the code would be something like:def titleToNumber(self, s: str) -> int:    result =0    for c in s:        result = result *26 + (ord(c) - ord('A') +1)    return resultWait, but what if the input is an empty string? According to the examples, the input is always a valid non-empty string, so perhaps we don't need to handle that case.Testing some examples:Test case 1: Input \\"A\\" → returns 1.Yes.Test case 2: \\"AB\\" → 26*1 +2 =28. Correct.Test case 3: \\"ZY\\" → 26*26 +25=701. Correct.Another test case: \\"AAA\\" → A is 1. So 1*26^2 + 1*26 +1 = 26^2 +26 +1= 676 +26+1=703.Wait, but according to the code:Processing first A: 0*26 +1=1.Second A: 1*26 +1=27.Third A: 27*26 +1= 703.Yes.So the code should handle all cases correctly.So the function should work as written.Now, implement that in Python as a method of the Solution class.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to convert an Excel column title into its corresponding column number. Excel columns follow a base-26 numbering system where 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., and 'Z' to 26. The challenge is to convert this unique base-26 system into a decimal number. ApproachThe approach involves treating each character in the input string as a digit in a base-26 number system, but with the twist that the digits start from 1 ('A') instead of 0. We process each character from left to right, updating the result by multiplying the current result by 26 (to shift the digits left) and adding the value of the current character.

Iterate through each character: For each character in the input string, convert it to its corresponding numerical value using the formula \`ord(c) - ord('A') + 1\`.

Update result: For each character, update the result by multiplying the current result by 26 (to shift the accumulated value left by one digit) and then adding the current character's value.

Let me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly.So, the mountain array conditions are: the length must be at least 3. Then there's some peak point i (not the first or last element) such that the array strictly increases up to i and then strictly decreases after i. Also, all the elements must follow these strictly increasing and decreasing sequences. Oh right, and the peak has to be in the middle somewhere, not at the ends. Let me think about examples. For example 3, [0,3,2,1] is valid because it increases to 3 (index 1) and then decreases. But example 2 [3,5,5] is invalid because there's a plateau, not strictly increasing. Example 1 is too short, so it's invalid.Hmm. So the approach here is to check for a peak and ensure that the array strictly increases until that peak and then strictly decreases after. Also, the peak can't be the first or last element.First, I need to check the length. If the array has less than 3 elements, return False immediately.Then, find the peak. But how? Because the peak is where the direction changes from increasing to decreasing. So maybe I can iterate through the array and find where the increasing stops and decreasing starts. But I need to make sure that there's exactly one peak and that it's not at the start or end.Wait, another approach: the mountain array has two phases. First, strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. So, the peak is the highest point. So, perhaps I can first check that the array increases as much as possible, then decreases. But how to find where the peak is.Let me think step by step.First, check if the array length is less than 3. If yes, return False.Then, we can start from the beginning and check for increasing until it stops. Then check for decreasing until the end. But also, the peak must not be at the first or last element. So for example, if the array is strictly increasing, then there's no decreasing part, so it's invalid. Similarly, if it's strictly decreasing, also invalid.So the steps could be:1. Check length >=3. If not, return False.2. Find the peak index. Let's walk up the mountain from the start until we can't anymore. The peak is where the next element is not larger than current.3. Check that the peak is not the first or last element. Because if the peak is at the end, then there's no decreasing part. If the peak is at the start, there's no increasing part.Wait, but the peak is the highest point. So in the first part, we need to strictly increase until the peak, then strictly decrease. So the peak is the highest point where the elements before are all increasing and the elements after are all decreasing.So perhaps the algorithm is:- Find the index where the array stops increasing. Let's call this i. Then, check that i is not 0 (since the array starts at 0) and not at the end. Then, check that from i onwards, the array is strictly decreasing until the end.Wait, but maybe the array increases, then decreases. So the peak is at i-1? Let's think.Wait, for example, in [0,3,2,1], the peak is at index 1. So, during the increasing phase, we start at 0 and go up to 3. Then we start decreasing. So, when we check for the increasing part, we can find the point where the next element is not larger. In this case, between 3 (index1) and 2 (index2), the next element is smaller. So the increasing stops at index1. Then, we have to check that from index1 to the end, it's strictly decreasing.But also, the peak can't be the last element. Because if the peak is at the last element, then there's no decreasing part. So the peak must be somewhere in the middle.Wait, let's outline steps:1. If len(A) <3, return False.2. Start from the beginning and walk as long as the elements are strictly increasing. Let's track the index where the increasing stops. Let's call this i. So, i starts at 0. While i+1 < len(A) and A[i] < A[i+1], increment i.   At this point, i is the peak index. Because the next element is not larger. So in the example [0,3,2,1], this loop would increment i to 1, since A[1] is 3 and A[2] is 2, which is smaller. So i=1.3. Now, check if i is 0 or i is the last index. If so, return False. Because if i is 0, that means there was no increasing (since even the first step failed), which would imply the array is strictly decreasing. But in that case, the peak would be at 0, which is invalid. Similarly, if i is the last index, then the array is strictly increasing, so no decreasing part.4. Then, check that from i to the end, the array is strictly decreasing. So, while i+1 < len(A) and A[i] > A[i+1], increment i. Wait, but after the initial i (the peak), we need to check all the way to the end. So we can walk from the peak to the end, checking that each step is strictly decreasing.   So after the initial peak i, if we can walk all the way to the end of the array (i reaches len(A)-1) by only moving when A[i] > A[i+1], then it's valid. Otherwise, there's a point where the next element is not smaller, which would invalidate the mountain.5. So, after the first loop (finding the peak), check if i is 0 or last. Then, in the second loop, check from peak i onward. If after the second loop, i is equal to the last index, then return True. Otherwise, return False.Wait, let's think with the example [0,3,2,1].First loop: i starts at 0.A[0] < A[1] → yes, i increments to 1.A[1] < A[2] → 3 < 2 → no. So loop stops. So peak is i=1.Check if i is 0 or i is len(A)-1. i=1, len(A) is 4. 1 is not 0, nor 3. So proceed.Then, the second loop: check from i=1 onwards. So j starts at 1.Check A[1] > A[2] → 3>2 → yes. j increments to 2.Check A[2] > A[3] → 2>1 → yes. j increments to 3. Now j is 3, which is the last index. So loop stops.Then, check if j equals len(A)-1. Yes. So return True.Another example: [3,5,5]. Let's see. First loop:A[0] =3, A[1]=5 → 3<5 → i increments to 1. Then, A[1]=5, A[2]=5 → 5 is not less than 5. So loop stops. i=1. Now check if i is 0 or last index (2). i=1 is not. Then second loop: check from i=1. A[1] =5 and A[2] =5 → 5>5 is false. So the second loop doesn't run. So j remains 1. Then, check if j is len(A)-1 (2). 1 !=2 → return False.Another example: [2,1]. Length is 2 → return False.Another test case: [1,2,3,4,5]. The first loop will take i up to 4 (since all are increasing). Then check if i is 0 or last index (4 is last). So returns False.Another test case: [5,4,3,2,1]. The first loop: i starts at 0. Check A[0] < A[1] → 5<4 is false. So i remains 0. Then, check if i is 0 → yes. Return False.Another case where after the peak, the array is not strictly decreasing. Like [0,3,2,3]. The first loop stops at i=1 (since 3>2 is next). Then check from i=1. The next elements are 2 and 3. 2>3 is false. So the second loop stops at i=1. Check if j ==3 (len-1 is 3). No. So return False.So the algorithm is:Check length >=3. If not, return False.Find i by walking up as far as possible. Then check if i is 0 or last. If yes, return False.Then walk down from i as far as possible. Then check if we reached the end. If yes, return True. Else, return False.So in code:def validMountainArray(A):    if len(A) <3:        return False    i =0    # walk up    while i < len(A)-1 and A[i] < A[i+1]:        i +=1    # check peak not start or end    if i ==0 or i == len(A)-1:        return False    # walk down    while i < len(A)-1 and A[i] > A[i+1]:        i +=1    # check if reached the end    return i == len(A)-1Yes, that seems right. Let me test this code against the examples.Example1: [2,1] → length <3 → False. Correct.Example2: [3,5,5]. Walk up: i starts at 0. A[0]=3 <5 → i=1. Then A[1]=5 is not <5. So i=1. Then check if i is 0 or 2? No. Then walk down: check A[1] >5? 5>5 is false. So loop doesn't run. i remains 1. Then check if i is 2. No → return False. Correct.Example3: [0,3,2,1]. Walk up: i=0 → 0<3 → i=1. Next 3>2 → stop. i=1. Not 0 or 3. Then walk down: i=1. Check 3>2 → i=2. 2>1 → i=3. Now i=3 is len-1 (3). Return True. Correct.Another test case: [1,3,2]. Walk up: i=0 → 1<3 → i=1. Then 3>2 → stop. Check i=1 not 0 or 2. Then walk down: i=1. Check 3>2 → i=2. Then check i=2 ==2? len-1 is 2. So yes. Return True. So [1,3,2] is valid. Correct.Another case where after peak, it's not strictly decreasing. Like [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,4]. Walk up: i increases to 4 (since 5 is peak). Then check i=4 is not 0 or 7. Then walk down: check 5>4 → i=5. 4>3 → i=6. Then next is 4. 3>4 is false. So loop stops. i is 6. Check if i is 7? No. So return False. Correct.So the code seems to handle these cases.Edge cases: when the array is strictly increasing then flat. Like [1,2,3,3,2]. The first loop would stop at i=2 (since A[2]=3 <3 is false). Then check i=2 not 0 or 4. Then walk down: A[2]=3 >3 is false. So loop doesn't run. i=2. So return False. Correct.Another edge case: when the array has a plateau before the peak. Like [1,2,2,3,2]. The first loop would check 1<2 → i=1. Then A[1]=2 and next is 2: not increasing. So i=1. Then walk down: 2>3 is false. So returns False. So the code correctly detects that the plateau before the peak is invalid.Wait, but in this case, the array increases, then plateaus, then increases again. So the code would have stopped at the first plateau. So the code will not consider that as a valid mountain. Correct, since the array must strictly increase to the peak.Another test case where the array increases, then decreases, then increases again. Like [1,3,2,4]. The code would first walk up to i=1 (3). Then walk down. Check 3>2 → i=2. Then check next 2>4 → false. So loop stops. i is 2. Check if i is 3? No. Return False. Which is correct, because after the peak, the array should be strictly decreasing. So any increase after the peak invalidates it.So the code seems to handle all these cases. Therefore, the code should be correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given array of integers is a valid mountain array.

There exists a peak element such that all elements before the peak are strictly increasing and all elements after the peak are strictly decreasing. The peak element cannot be the first or last element of the array. ApproachThe approach to solve this problem involves three main steps:1. Check the Length: If the length of the array is less than 3, return false immediately as it cannot form a valid mountain array.2. Find the Peak: Traverse the array from the start to find the peak where the elements stop increasing. If the peak is at the start or end of the array, return false.3. Check Decreasing Sequence: From the peak, check if the remaining elements to the end of the array are strictly decreasing.

Check Length: The first condition checks if the array length is less than 3, which immediately disqualifies it as a mountain array.2. Find the Peak: We start from the beginning of the array and move upwards until we find a peak where the next element is not greater. This peak must not be the first or last element of the array.3. Check Decreasing Sequence: From the peak, we check if the elements strictly decrease until the end of the array.

The task is to determine if Alice wins given N, assuming both play optimally. Hmm. Let's think through this step by step.First, the examples: when N=2, Alice subtracts 1 (the only possible divisor) leaving 1. Bob can't move, so Alice wins. For N=3, Alice subtracts 1, leaving 2. Bob then subtracts 1, leaving 1. Alice can't move, so she loses. So the output is false here.Wait, what's the pattern here? Let's see. Let's think about smaller N values and see if we can find a pattern.Let's list out the possible outcomes for small N:N=1: No moves possible. Alice can't play, so she loses. Output is False.N=2: Alice takes 1, leaves 1. Bob can't. Alice wins. Output True.N=3: Alice takes 1, leaves 2. Bob takes 1, wins. So Alice loses. Output False.N=4: Let's see. Alice's options are x=1, 2. Let's see each possibility.If she takes 1, leaves 3. Then Bob is in the same situation as N=3. Which we know Bob would lose if he's in that scenario. Wait, no. Wait, when N=3, the player whose turn it is (Alice) loses. So if Alice takes 1 from 4, leaving 3 for Bob, then Bob's turn with N=3. From N=3, the current player (Bob) can take 1, leaving 2. Then Alice's turn, she takes 1, leaves 1. Bob can't. So Alice would win. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused here.Wait, let's re-examine N=4. Let's think recursively. For each possible x (divisor of N), the next state is N-x. The current player can win if there's at least one x such that the next state leads to the opponent's loss.So for N=4:Possible x's are 1, 2.Case 1: x=1. Next N is 3. Now it's Bob's turn. For N=3, does the current player (Bob) win? Let's see. Bob's possible x's are 1. He subtracts 1 to get 2. Then Alice's turn with N=2. She takes 1, leaves 1. Bob can't. So Alice wins. So for N=3, the current player (Bob) can force a win. So when Alice takes x=1, she leaves Bob with a winning position. So if Alice takes x=1, she loses.Case 2: x=2. Subtract 2, leaving N=2. Now it's Bob's turn. N=2, Bob takes 1, leaves 1. Alice can't move. So Bob wins. So if Alice takes x=2, she leaves Bob in a winning position again. Wait, but wait: when Bob is at N=2, he can take x=1. Then Alice has no moves. So Bob wins. So in this case, when Alice subtracts 2, she gives Bob a position where he can win. So in both possible moves for N=4, Alice's options lead to Bob winning. Therefore, Alice cannot win when N=4? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, no. Let's re-examine. If Alice subtracts x=2, then N becomes 4-2=2. Bob's turn. For N=2, the current player (Bob) can take x=1, leaving N=1. Alice can't move. So Bob wins. So Alice's move of x=2 leads to Bob winning. So in N=4, Alice can't choose any x that leads to Bob losing. So the answer for N=4 would be False. But wait, according to the sample input N=2, Alice wins. So maybe there's a pattern where even N's are wins and odd are losses?Wait, let's check N=4 again. Wait, perhaps there's another possibility. Let me think again. When Alice subtracts x=2, N becomes 2. Bob's turn. He can take 1, leaving 1. Then Alice can't. So Bob wins. So in both cases, Alice leaves Bob with a winning position. So Alice loses when N is 4? But according to that, the answer for N=4 is False. But according to the pattern of even/odd, even numbers would be winning positions, so N=4 would be a win for Alice. Hmm, this suggests that the pattern isn't simply even/odd.Wait, perhaps my analysis is wrong. Let me check N=4 again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the possible x options. For N=4, the possible x's are 1, 2. So when Alice subtracts x=1, N becomes 3. Bob's turn. For N=3, the player (Bob) subtracts 1, leaving 2. Alice's turn. She subtracts 1, leaves 1. Bob can't move. So Alice wins. Wait, that's a chain of events. Let's break it down step by step.If Alice takes x=1 from 4, leaving 3. Bob's turn. He can take x=1 (only option) leaving 2. Alice's turn: takes x=1, leaves 1. Bob can't. So Alice wins. Wait, that would mean that when N=4, if Alice takes x=1, Bob is in N=3. Then Bob takes 1, leading to N=2. Alice's turn, takes 1, Bob loses. So in this case, Alice would win. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion.Wait, so for N=4:If Alice chooses x=1, leaving N=3 for Bob.Bob's options for N=3: x=1. So he subtracts 1, leaving N=2 for Alice.Alice's turn with N=2: she subtracts 1, leaving 1. Bob can't. Alice wins.So in this case, when N=4, if Alice subtracts x=1, she can win. So that would mean that N=4 is a winning position. So Alice can win here. So the answer for N=4 is True.Hmm, so my previous analysis was wrong. So why? Because when I first considered x=1 for N=4, I thought that Bob would end up in N=3, which was a losing position. But in reality, when Bob is at N=3, he can make a move (x=1) leading to N=2, which is a winning position for Alice. Wait, but for the current player, if the next state is a winning position for the opponent, then the current player is in a losing position.Wait, perhaps the logic is: for a given N, if there's any x such that the next state (N-x) is a losing position for the opponent, then the current player can win by choosing that x.So let's model this recursively. For each N, if any of the possible x's (divisors) leads to a position where the next player cannot win, then current player can win.So, for example:Base case:N=1: current player cannot move, so loses. So return False.N=2: possible x=1. Next N is 1. The next player (Bob) can't move, so current player (Alice) wins. So return True.N=3: x can be 1. Next N is 2. Next player (Bob) can win (as N=2 is a win for the current player). So current player (Alice) can't force a loss on Bob, so Alice loses. So return False.N=4: x can be 1 or 2.If x=1: next N is 3. For N=3, the current player (Bob) can't win (as per N=3's result is False). So Alice can choose x=1 and Bob will lose. So N=4 returns True.Wait, wait. Because if N=3 is a losing position for the current player (Bob), then choosing x=1 for N=4 would make Bob face a losing position, so Alice can win. So N=4 is a winning position. So the answer is True.So for N=4, the answer is True. So perhaps the pattern is that even numbers are winning positions?Let's check N=5.N=5: possible x's are 1. Subtract 1 to get 4. Now it's Bob's turn. For N=4, which is a winning position, so Bob can win. So Alice can't choose any x that leads to Bob being in a losing position. So N=5 returns False.Hmm. So N=1 (odd) → False. N=2 (even) → True. N=3 (odd) → False. N=4 (even) → True. N=5 (odd) → False. So this suggests that the answer is True when N is even, False when odd. Let's test for N=6.N=6: possible x's are 1,2,3.If Alice chooses x=1, N becomes 5 (Bob's turn). For N=5, the current player (Bob) can't win (since N=5 is odd, and per the pattern returns False). So if Alice subtracts 1, Bob is in a losing position. So Alice can win. Therefore, N=6 returns True.This seems to fit the pattern. So maybe the solution is that Alice wins if and only if N is even.But wait, let's check N=6. Let's think of another possible x.Suppose Alice chooses x=3 for N=6. Then N becomes 3. Bob's turn. For N=3, which is a losing position (returns False). So Bob can't win. So Alice can choose x=3 and win. So the answer for N=6 is True.Yes. So the pattern seems to hold. So the conclusion is that when N is even, Alice can win. When N is odd, she loses.But why is that the case?Let's think of the game dynamics. Each move subtracts a proper divisor x of N, which is at least 1. Since x must be a divisor of N, x must be a factor of N. So when N is even, subtracting x (which could be even or odd) leads to N-x. But wait, perhaps the key is that for even N, there exists a move that leaves the opponent with an odd N, and for odd N, all possible moves subtract a divisor (which must be odd, since even numbers can't divide odd numbers) leading to an even N.Wait, let's see. For even N: possible divisors include 1 and other even numbers. For example, N=4, divisors are 1,2. So subtracting 2 (even) would give 2 (even). Wait, but then Bob's turn is N=2, which is even. So that would allow Bob to win. But according to our previous analysis, for even N, the current player can win.Wait, perhaps the key is that even numbers can be reduced to odd numbers, and odd numbers can only be reduced to even numbers.Let's think: For even N, subtracting 1 (a divisor) would result in N-1 being odd. For odd N, all divisors are odd (since even numbers can't divide into an odd N). So subtracting an odd x from an odd N gives an even N. So the players are forced to alternate between even and odd.Now, the losing position is when N=1 (odd). So the player who gets N=1 loses.So if the initial N is even, Alice can subtract 1 each time, leading Bob to an odd N. Then Bob is forced to subtract 1 (since that's the only possible divisor for an odd N greater than 1?), leading Alice back to even. This continues until Alice gets N=2, subtracts 1, and Bob can't move. So Alice wins.Wait, but what about N=6. Suppose Alice subtracts 3, which is an odd divisor. Then N becomes 3 (odd). Bob's turn. He subtracts 1 (the only possible divisor), leading to 2. Alice's turn. She subtracts 1, Bob can't. So Alice wins. So in this case, the even N allows Alice to choose a move that leads to an odd N, which then forces Bob into a losing path.So the key seems to be that even numbers can choose to subtract 1 (resulting in odd N) which is a losing position for the opponent.So the conclusion is that Alice wins if and only if N is even.But wait, let's think about N=6 again. What if Alice subtracts 2, which is even. Then N becomes 4 (even). Bob's turn. He can subtract 1, leading to 3 (odd). Alice subtracts 1, leading to 2. Bob subtracts 1, leading to 1. Alice can't. So Bob wins. So in this scenario, if Alice chooses x=2 (even), she could lose. But according to the even/odd hypothesis, even N is a winning position. So why is that?Because the hypothesis is that if N is even, the current player can make a move that forces the next player into a losing position. So the player can choose x=1 (which is always a valid divisor for any N>1) to subtract, leading to N-1 (odd). Then the next player is forced to subtract 1 (since for odd N, all divisors are odd), leading to even again. This continues until N=1, which is a loss for the player whose turn it is.So the optimal play for even N is to subtract 1 each time, forcing the opponent into an odd position where they can only subtract 1, leading back to even. So the even numbers are winning positions, and odds are losing.So the final answer is that Alice wins if and only if N is even.But wait, let's test this for N=6. Suppose Alice chooses x=3. Then N becomes 3. Bob subtracts 1, N becomes 2. Alice subtracts 1, Bob can't. So Alice wins. So she can choose x=3, leading to a winning path. Alternatively, if she chooses x=2, leading to 4. Bob can choose x=1 (leading to 3) or x=2 (leading to 2). If Bob chooses x=2, N becomes 2. Alice subtracts 1, wins. If Bob chooses x=1, N becomes 3. Alice subtracts 1, leading to 2. Bob subtracts 1, Alice can't. So Bob wins.But since both players play optimally, Bob would choose the move that maximizes his chances of winning. So if in N=4, Bob can choose x=2 (leading to 2) which is a winning position for him. Because for N=2, the current player can take 1 and win. So in the scenario where Alice subtracts x=2, leading to N=4 for Bob, he can choose x=2, leading to N=2. Alice's turn, she subtracts 1, Bob can't. So Bob wins.So the key is that when N is even, the current player can choose a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. For example, when N is even, subtract 1 (if possible) to make it odd. But what about when N is even but the subtraction of 1 is not possible? Wait, 1 is a divisor of all numbers except 1. So for N>1, 1 is always a valid x. So when N is even and greater than 1, the current player can subtract 1, leading to N-1 (odd). The next player (Bob) is now faced with an odd N. Since for an odd N, all divisors are odd (because even divisors can't divide into an odd number). So when Bob subtracts x (which is odd), N-x becomes even. Then Alice's turn: even again. This continues until N becomes 1, which is odd. So the player who receives N=1 loses.So for even N, the current player can always subtract 1, leading to an odd N-1. Then Bob has to subtract an odd x, leading to even again. This cycle continues until N is 2, then 1. So Alice wins.So the conclusion is that Alice wins if and only if N is even. So the code can be as simple as checking if N is even. But wait, let's check N=6 again. What if Alice subtracts x=3 (a divisor of 6). Then N becomes 3 (odd). Bob's turn. He subtracts 1, leaving 2. Alice subtracts 1, Bob can't. So Alice wins. So regardless of the x chosen (as long as it's a divisor), as long as the player subtracts a value that leaves the opponent in a losing position, they can win.But the key is that for even N, there exists at least one x (like x=1) that leads to an odd N, which is a losing position. For odd N, all possible x's are odd (since even x's can't divide into an odd N). So subtracting an odd x from an odd N leaves an even N (even = odd - odd). So the next player is faced with an even N, which is a winning position. Therefore, the current player (with odd N) can't force a win. Hence, all odd N's are losing positions, and even N's are winning.Thus, the code can simply return N % 2 == 0. But wait, let's test N=1. According to this, it's odd, so returns False. Correct. N=2 returns True, which is correct. N=3 returns False. Correct. N=4 returns True. Correct.So the solution is to check if N is even. Therefore, the code is straightforward.But why did the problem have examples that fit this pattern? Let me check the examples again.Example 1: Input 2 (even) → True. Correct.Example 2: Input 3 (odd) → False. Correct.So the code can be written as:def divisorGame(N: int) -> bool:    return N % 2 == 0But wait, let's think again for N=6. Suppose Alice subtracts x=2 (even), leading to N=4. Bob's turn. For N=4, which is even. Bob can choose x=1, leading to N=3 (odd). Then Alice's turn: subtract 1, leading to 2. Bob subtracts 1, leading to 1. Alice can't. So Bob wins. But this would imply that Alice's move of x=2 (even) leads to her losing. However, since both players play optimally, Alice would choose a move that ensures her victory. So she can choose x=1, leading to N=5 (Bob's turn, which is odd). Bob subtracts 1, leading to 4. Alice subtracts 1, leading to 3. Bob subtracts 1, leading to 2. Alice subtracts 1, wins. So the optimal play is for Alice to subtract 1 each time. So the code holds.Thus, the conclusion is that Alice wins if N is even, else loses. So the code is as simple as checking if N is even.But the problem says that both players play optimally, which supports the idea that the even/odd pattern holds.Therefore, the Python function would be:class Solution:    def divisorGame(self, N: int) -> bool:        return N % 2 == 0But wait, let me check the case where N=6 and Alice subtracts x=3. Then N becomes 3 (Bob's turn). Bob subtracts 1 (N=2). Alice subtracts 1 (N=1). Bob can't. So Alice wins. So regardless of the x chosen, if it's a divisor, the even/odd pattern holds.So yes, the code is correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if Alice can win a game where she and Bob take turns subtracting a proper divisor of the current number on the chalkboard. Alice starts first, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The key insight is that the outcome of the game can be determined based on whether the initial number ( N ) is even or odd. ApproachThe optimal strategy for both players revolves around the parity (even or odd) of the number ( N ):1. Even ( N ): If ( N ) is even, Alice can always subtract 1 (a valid divisor for any even number) to leave Bob with an odd number. For odd numbers, all possible divisors are odd, and subtracting an odd number from an odd number results in an even number. This forces Bob into a cycle where he always leaves Alice with an even number, eventually leading Bob to lose when the number reduces to 1.2.

But wait, the problem says to include the primary diagonal and the secondary diagonal, but not include elements that are part of both (since they should be counted only once). Let's think through this.First, let's understand the examples. For example 1, the matrix is 3x3. The primary diagonal is 1,5,9. The secondary diagonal is 3,5,7. But since 5 is in both, it's counted once. So the sum is 1+5+9 +3+7 = 25. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the secondary diagonal elements that are not part of the primary. So in the primary, the elements are (i,i), and the secondary are (i, n-1 -i). So when the matrix has odd dimensions, the center element is part of both. So in that case, we should subtract it once because it's added twice in the sum of both diagonals.So the approach might be: sum all elements of the primary and secondary diagonals, then subtract the center element if the matrix has odd size.Let me think of steps:1. Calculate the sum of the primary diagonal. That's elements where row == col.2. Calculate the sum of the secondary diagonal. That's elements where row + col = n-1. So for each row i, the column is n-1 -i.3. Add both sums.4. If n is odd, subtract the center element (since it was added twice). Because when n is odd, the primary and secondary diagonals intersect at the center element. So for example, in a 3x3 matrix, the element at (1,1) is in both diagonals. So adding both diagonals would count it twice. So we need to subtract it once.Wait, but how do I check if n is odd? Well, n is the length of the matrix. So for example, if n is 3, then (n % 2) is 1, so it's odd. Then the center element is at (n//2, n//2). So in that case, subtract mat[n//2][n//2].So the steps would be:Initialize sum to 0.Loop through each row i:- Add mat[i][i] (primary diagonal)- Add mat[i][n-1 -i] (secondary diagonal)Then, check if n is odd. If yes, subtract mat[n//2][n//2], because that element was added twice.So, putting this into code.Let's test this logic against the examples.Example 1:mat is 3x3. n is 3, which is odd.Primary sum: 1 +5 +9 =15.Secondary sum: 3 +5 +7 =15. Total sum 30. But since n is odd, subtract 5 once. 30-5=25. Which matches the example.Example 2:4x4 matrix. All elements are 1. n is even (4), so no subtraction.Primary diagonal: 1,1,1,1. Sum 4.Secondary diagonal: 1,1,1,1. Sum 4. Total 8. Which matches the example.Example3: 1x1 matrix. sum is 5. Since n is odd (1), we subtract 5 once? Wait no: the primary and secondary diagonals would both add 5. So sum would be 5+5=10, then subtract 5 once. Result 5. Which is correct.So the logic seems solid.Now, how to implement this in Python.The code will take the list of lists mat. n is len(mat). Then:sum_diag = 0for i in range(n):    sum_diag += mat[i][i] + mat[i][n-1 -i]if n % 2 ==1:    sum_diag -= mat[n//2][n//2]return sum_diagYes, that's the code.Let's test edge cases. For n=2:mat = [[1,2],[3,4]]Primary diagonal: 1 and 4. Secondary: 2 and3. Sum 1+4+2+3=10. n is even, so no subtraction. So answer is 10.Another example for n=5:The center element is at (2,2). So in the sum, it's added twice (once in primary and once in secondary). So subtract once.So code handles that.Thus, the code should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of the elements on both the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix, ensuring that elements common to both diagonals (in the case of an odd-sized matrix) are counted only once.

It can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique. Example 1:Input: nums = [3,5]Output: 2Explanation: There are 2 values (3 and 5) that are greater than or equal to 2.Example 2:Input: nums = [0,0]Output: -1Explanation: No numbers fit the criteria for x.If x = 0, there should be 0 numbers >= x, but there are 2.If x = 1, there should be 1 number >= x, but there are 0.If x = 2, there should be 2 numbers >= x, but there are 0.x cannot be greater since there are only 2 numbers in nums.Example 3:Input: nums = [0,4,3,0,4]Output: 3Explanation: There are 3 values that are greater than or equal to 3.Example 4:Input: nums = [3,6,7,7,0]Output: -1 Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find a special x in the array such that exactly x numbers are greater than or equal to x. If there's no such x, return -1. Let's think about how to approach this.First, let's understand the problem with the examples. In example 1, nums is [3,5]. The output is 2 because exactly two numbers are >= 2. For x=1, there are two numbers >=1, which is more than x. For x=3, there are two numbers >=3 (3 and5), but 2 is not equal to 3. So x=2 is correct.The key is to find x such that the count of elements >=x is exactly x. And x can be any non-negative integer, not necessarily in the array. Also, the constraints say that if such x exists, it's unique.So the steps I need to take are:1. For each possible x, count how many numbers in the array are >=x.2. Check if that count equals x.3. If such an x exists, return it. Otherwise, return -1.But what are the possible values of x to check? Since the array has length n, x can't be larger than n. Because if x were larger than n, then there can't be x elements in the array (since there are only n elements). So the maximum possible x we need to check is n.Wait, the array length is n. So for x to be possible, x must be in the range 0 to n, inclusive. Because even x=0 could be possible (but in that case, the count must be 0, which means all elements are less than 0. But since all elements are non-negative, the only way for count to be 0 is if x=0 and all elements are 0? Wait, no. Wait, if x is 0, the condition is that exactly 0 elements are >=0. But all elements are non-negative, so they are all >=0. So the count would be n, which can't be 0. So x=0 is impossible unless the array is empty, which isn't possible because constraints say 1<=nums.length. So x can be from 1 to n, inclusive?Wait, the constraints say 1 <= nums.length <=100, so the array is never empty. So x can't be 0 because the count would be the entire array, which is >=0. So x can't be 0, right? So possible x values are from 1 to n.Wait, in example 2, input is [0,0], which has length 2. Possible x's are 1 and 2. Let's see:For x=1: count numbers >=1. Both are 0, so count is 0. 0 !=1. For x=2: count is 0. So no x exists, hence return -1.So the possible x values are 1 up to n.So the plan is:- For x in 1 to len(nums) inclusive:   - count the number of elements in nums that are >=x.   - if count ==x, return x.- If none found, return -1.But how efficient is this?The array can be up to 100 elements. For each x (up to 100), we need to count how many elements are >=x. So for each x, we loop through all elements (100 steps). So 100 * 100 = 10,000 operations. That's acceptable.But maybe we can optimize this. For example, sorting the array first. Then, for each x, find the first element that is >=x and calculate how many elements are from that point onwards. That would reduce the count step to O(log n) per x.Let's think. For example, if we sort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, for a given x, the count of elements >=x is equal to len(nums) - the index of the first element >=x. So we can use binary search for this.So steps:1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.2. For x in 1 to len(nums):   a. Use binary search to find the first index where element is >=x.   b. count = len(nums) - index.   c. if count ==x, return x.3. If none found, return -1.This would be O(n log n) for sorting, plus O(n log n) for checking each x. So overall O(n log n), which is better for large n. But given that n is up to 100, the initial approach may be acceptable. However, implementing the binary search method would be more efficient, especially for larger n (even though n here is small).Let me think about how to implement this.Sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Then for each x, perform a binary search to find the leftmost element >=x. The count is then len(nums) - pos.For example, sorted array [3,5]. For x=2, binary search finds the first element >=2 is 3 at index 0. So count is 2-0=2, which equals x=2. So return 2.Another example, sorted [0,0], x=1. Find first >=1. All elements are 0, which are less than 1. So index is 2 (since all elements are less, the count is 0). So count is 0, which is not equal to x=1. For x=2, same thing.So let's code this.In Python, we can use the bisect module. The bisect_left function returns the insertion point for x in a sorted array. So if we do bisect_left(nums, x), the result is the first index where elements are >=x. Wait, no. Wait, bisect_left finds the insertion point for x in a sorted list, so that the list remains sorted. So for example, in a list sorted in non-decreasing order, if we have elements >=x, the insertion point is the first such element's index.Wait, the bisect_left function returns the first index where you can insert x so that the array remains sorted. For example, in array [3,5], x=2: bisect_left returns 0, which is correct. So the count is len(nums) - index = 2-0=2.Yes. So for each x, the count is len(nums) - bisect.bisect_left(sorted_nums, x).So the steps for code:1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.2. Iterate x from 1 to len(nums) inclusive.3. For each x, compute the count as len(nums) - bisect_left(sorted_nums, x).4. If count ==x, return x.5. After checking all x, return -1.So the code would look like:import bisectdef specialArray(nums):    nums.sort()    n = len(nums)    for x in range(1, n+1):        idx = bisect.bisect_left(nums, x)        count = n - idx        if count == x:            return x    return -1Wait, but in example 3, input is [0,4,3,0,4]. Sorted is [0,0,3,4,4]. The length is 5. We check x from 1 to 5.For x=3: bisect_left finds the first element >=3 is index 2 (element 3). count is 5-2=3. So 3 ==3, return 3. Which matches the example.Another example: input [3,6,7,7,0]. Wait, no, example 4 input is [3,6,7,7,0]. Sorted is [0,3,6,7,7]. Length is 5.Check x from 1 to 5:x=1: count elements >=1. All except 0. So 4 elements. 4 !=1.x=2: count elements >=2. All except 0. 4 !=2.x=3: elements >=3 are 3,6,7,7. count=4. 4 !=3.x=4: elements >=4 are 6,7,7. count=3. 3 !=4.x=5: elements >=5 are 6,7,7. count=3 !=5. So no x found. Return -1.Which is correct.What about edge cases?Test case where x is n. For example, nums = [5,5], n=2. x=2. How many elements >=2? 2. So returns 2.Another test case: nums = [1,2,3,4], n=4. Check x=4: elements >=4 is 1 (only 4). So 1 !=4.x=3: elements >=3 are 3,4. count=2 !=3.x=2: elements >=2 are 3 elements (2,3,4). count=3. x=2, so 3 !=2. So no.Wait, but 3 is not equal to 2. So returns -1?Hmm. So no x exists here.Another test case: nums = [2,3,3]. n=3.x=3: count elements >=3: two elements (3,3). count=2 !=3.x=2: elements >=2: all three. count=3. x=2? 3 !=2. So no.x=1: count elements >=1: 3. 3 !=1. So returns -1.Wait, but what about x=3. The count is 2. So 2 !=3. So no.So in this case, returns -1.Another test case: nums = [1,1,2]. n=3.Check x=2: elements >=2 are one element (2). count=1. Not 2.x=3: elements >=3? None. count=0. No.x=1: count elements >=1: 3. So 3 !=1. So returns -1.But what about x=2. Count is 1. Not equal.Hmm.So the code seems to handle these cases.What about when x is exactly the count. Like in the first example.So the code should work.So the approach is:Sort the array, then for each x in 1..n, compute the count using binary search, and check if equals x.Yes.So that's the plan. Now, code this in Python, using the bisect module.But need to import bisect. So in the function, after sorting, loop x from 1 to n inclusive.Now, code:The problem requires the function to be part of the Solution class, and the function is called specialArray, taking nums as a parameter, which is a List of integers.So in the code:import bisectfrom typing import Listclass Solution:    def specialArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        nums.sort()        n = len(nums)        for x in range(1, n+1):            idx = bisect.bisect_left(nums, x)            count = n - idx            if count == x:                return x        return -1Testing example 2: nums = [0,0]. After sorting, [0,0]. For x=1: bisect_left returns 0, since 0 <1. So count is 2-0=2. 2 !=1. x=2: count is 0 (since all elements <2). 0 !=2. So return -1.Yes.Another test case: nums = [3,5]. sorted as [3,5]. x=2: bisect_left finds 0, count 2. return 2.Yes.Another test case: nums = [0,4,3,0,4]. sorted to [0,0,3,4,4]. x=3: bisect_left finds index 2. count is 5-2=3. return 3.Yes.So the code seems correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a number ( x ) such that exactly ( x ) numbers in the given array are greater than or equal to ( x ).

Let's see. The task is to determine the winner based on the given moves. Let's think about how to approach this.First, the game is played by A and B, with A placing X's first, then B with O's. Each move is a position in the grid. The game ends when someone wins by having three in a row, column, or diagonal. Or if all squares are filled (draw). Otherwise, if there are still moves left, it's pending.So, the steps I need to do are:1. Create a 3x3 grid to track the moves.2. Simulate the moves, alternating between A and B. Since the moves are given in order, each move alternates between X and O. For example, even indices (0, 2, 4...) are A's moves (X), odd are B's (O).3. After each move, check if that move caused the player to win. If at any point a player wins, the game ends immediately, so we return that player.4. Once all moves are processed, if no one has won, check if all 9 moves are done. If yes, return 'Draw'. Otherwise, 'Pending'.So the main challenge is efficiently checking for a win after each move. Because checking all possible lines after every move could be time-consuming, but since the grid is only 3x3, it's manageable.How to check if the last move caused a win? Well, the win can occur in the row, column, or either diagonal that the move is part of.For example, when a player places a mark at (row, col), we need to check:- All three cells in the same row (row, 0), (row,1), (row,2)- All three in the same column (0, col), (1, col), (2, col)- If the move is on a diagonal, check that diagonal. For example, (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) is the main diagonal. The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).So, for each move, after placing the symbol (X or O), we check the row, column, and possibly the two diagonals. If any of these are all the same symbol, then that player wins.So the plan is:- Initialize a 3x3 grid filled with empty strings (or maybe ' ' as per examples)- Iterate over each move in the moves list, alternating between 'X' and 'O' for A and B.- After each move, check if the current player has won.- If a win is detected, return the player (A or B) immediately.- After all moves, if no winner, check the number of moves. If 9, return 'Draw', else 'Pending'.Now, let's think about how to represent the grid. Maybe a list of lists, each cell is 'X', 'O', or ' '.For each move in the moves list:- For index i, if even, it's A's move (X), else B's (O).- So for the i-th move (0-based), if i is even (since first move is 0), player is A.Wait, the first move is A (X), then B (O), etc. So for moves[0], player A; moves[1], B; etc. So for each move in the list, the player is A if the index is even (0,2,4, etc.), B if odd.So when processing each move, we can determine which player's turn it is.Then, for each move, we place the 'X' or 'O' on the grid.Once placed, check for a win.So, the key is after each move, check if that move caused the player to win.How to check for a win?Let's say the current move is at (r, c). The player's symbol is s ('X' or 'O').Check the row r: all three in that row must be s.Check the column c: all three in that column must be s.Check if (r,c) is on the main diagonal (i.e., r == c), then check the main diagonal.Check if (r,c) is on the anti-diagonal (r + c == 2), then check the anti-diagonal.If any of these checks are true, then the player wins.For example, if the move is (1,1), which is on both diagonals, so check both.So the steps for checking a win after a move at (r,c) are:1. Check the row r: grid[r][0], grid[r][1], grid[r][2] must all be the same as s.2. Check the column c: grid[0][c], grid[1][c], grid[2][c] must all be s.3. If r == c, check main diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).4. If r + c == 2, check anti-diagonal (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).If any of these four checks are true, return True for a win.So, for each move, after placing the symbol, we perform these checks.So, code steps:Initialize grid as 3x3 with ' '.For i in range(len(moves)):   current move is moves[i]   r, c = move[0], move[1]   if i is even: s = 'X' (player A)   else: s = 'O' (player B)   grid[r][c] = s   then check if this move caused a win.   if win:       return 'A' if s is 'X' else 'B'After all moves:   if len(moves) ==9: return 'Draw'   else: return 'Pending'Now, how to implement the check_win function.Let's write a helper function that takes r, c, s, grid, and returns True if the move resulted in a win.Alternatively, inline the checks.In code:After setting grid[r][c] = s:Check row:if all(grid[r][j] == s for j in range(3)):    return the player.Check column:if all(grid[i][c] == s for i in range(3)):    return.Check diagonal 1 (r == c):if r == c and all(grid[i][i] == s for i in range(3)):    return.Check diagonal 2 (r + c == 2):if (r + c) == 2 and all(grid[i][2-i] == s for i in range(3)):    return.If any of these are true, then the player has won.So in code, after placing the symbol:s = 'X' or 'O'if (check_row(r, s) or check_col(c, s) or check_diag1(r, c, s) or check_diag2(r, c, s)):   then return the player.Implementing these checks:Check row: all elements in grid[r] are s.Check column: all grid[i][c] for i in 0-2.Check diagonal1: if r == c, check grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2] == s.Check diagonal2: if r + c == 2, check grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0] == s.So in code:def check_win(r, c, s, grid):    # Check row    if all(cell == s for cell in grid[r]):        return True    # Check column    if all(grid[i][c] == s for i in range(3)):        return True    # Check main diagonal    if r == c and all(grid[i][i] == s for i in range(3)):        return True    # Check anti-diagonal    if (r + c == 2) and all(grid[i][2 - i] == s for i in range(3)):        return True    return FalseSo, after each move, we call this check, and if true, return the player.Now, let's think about possible edge cases.Example 1: the last move is by A (as in example 1), and the three in a row is made. So the code correctly returns A.Example 2: B's move creates a three in a row, returns B.Test case where after 5 moves, there is a winner. The code should return immediately, not process all 9 moves.So the code should process each move in order, and after each, check if the current player has won.Another edge case: when a player fills a row, column, or diagonal on their turn. But according to the problem statement, the moves are valid, so once the game is over, there are no more moves. So the code can process all moves, but the first time a winning move is found, returns that player.But the problem says that moves is valid. So the code can process all moves, but if a win is found at any step, return the winner. Because once the game ends, no more moves are played. But the moves list is valid, so after a win, there are no more moves. So for example, if a player wins on the 5th move (total moves 5), then moves list has exactly 5 elements, and the code returns the winner.So during processing each move, after placing the symbol, check if the player wins, and return immediately.So code steps:Initialize grid as 3x3 ' '.Loop through each move in moves:   determine player (A if even index, B if odd)   place X or O in grid[r][c]   check for win.   if win, return the player.After all moves:   if len(moves) ==9: return 'Draw'   else: return 'Pending'Now, coding this in Python.The function is to be called tictactoe, and takes moves as a list of lists.So:class Solution:    def tictactoe(self, moves: List[List[int]]) -> str:        grid = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]        for i, (r, c) in enumerate(moves):            player = 'A' if i % 2 ==0 else 'B'            symbol = 'X' if player == 'A' else 'O'            grid[r][c] = symbol            # Check if this move caused a win            # Check row            if all(cell == symbol for cell in grid[r]):                return player            # Check column            if all(grid[i][c] == symbol for i in range(3)):                return player            # Check diagonals            if r == c and all(grid[i][i] == symbol for i in range(3)):                return player            if r + c == 2 and all(grid[i][2-i] == symbol for i in range(3)):                return player        # After all moves:        if len(moves) ==9:            return 'Draw'        else:            return 'Pending'Wait, but in the code above, after each move, we check for the win. But in the case where a player wins in their move, which could be even or odd index.But according to the problem, the moves are valid. So once a player wins, there are no more moves. So the code can check each move and return immediately upon detecting a win.Wait, for example, in example 2:moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]The moves are 6 in total. Let's see:Player for each move:0: A (X)1: B (O)2: A (X)3: B (O)4: A (X)5: B (O)Wait, but the indexes are 0-based. So 0: A, 1: B, 2: A, 3: B, 4: A, 5: B.In example 2, the last move is index 5, which is B's move. So when that move is placed, the code checks if B's O is in a winning position.In example 2's explanation, the B's move is the 6th move (since each player alternates). But according to the code, each move is processed and checked.But the code returns B when the check passes.Now, let's think about example 2:The moves are [0,0] (A), [1,1] (B), [0,1] (A), [0,2] (B), [1,0] (A), [2,0] (B). So the last move is (2,0) by B.After placing O at (2,0), check for win.Check row 2: O, then what's in the other columns? The row would be grid[2][0] is O, grid[2][1] is empty, grid[2][2] is empty. So row check is no.Check column 0: grid[0][0] is X (from A), grid[1][0] is X (A's 4th move?), wait no. Let's process all moves step by step.Wait, let's simulate:Move 0: (0,0) by A → X. Check row 0: X, then two spaces. Not a win. Column 0: X, then two spaces. Not a win. Diagonal (0,0 is part of main diagonal. So check all three: X, but others are empty. So no.Move 1: (1,1) by B → O. Check row 1: O, two empty. No. Column 1: O and two empty. Check diagonal (1,1 is on main and anti). For main diagonal: (0,0) X, (1,1) O, (2,2) empty. Not same. So no. Anti-diagonal: (0,2) empty, (1,1) O, (2,0) empty. So no. So no win.Move 2: (0,1) by A → X. Check row 0: X, X, empty. Not all. Column 1: X (A's 0,1?), but B's 1,1 is O. So no. No diagonal. So no win.Move 3: (0,2) by B → O. Check row 0: X, X, O. Not all O. Column 2: O (from B) and two empties. Check anti-diagonal: (0,2) O, (1,1) O, (2,0) empty. Not all O. So no win.Move 4: (1,0) by A → X. Check row 1: X (from A's move here?), but B has O in (1,1). So row 1 has X, O, empty. No. Column 0: X (0,0), X (1,0), empty. So column 0 has X, X, empty. Not all. So no win.Move 5: (2,0) by B → O. Check row 2: O, empty, empty. No. Column 0: X (0,0), X (1,0), O (2,0). So column 0 has X, X, O → not all O. But what's B's symbol here? The code here checks if all in column 0 are O. But in column 0, there's X, X, O. So no. Then check diagonals: the move is (2,0). So row + column is 2+0=2 → which is the anti-diagonal. So check if anti-diagonal has all O. The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So (0,2) is O (from move 3), (1,1) is O (move 1), (2,0) is O (current move). So all O's. So the code's check for anti-diagonal would return True. So B wins.So the code returns 'B' as expected.So the code works for example 2.Another example: example 4, where moves are [[0,0],[1,1]] → two moves. After each move, check for win. After first move (A places X at (0,0)): check row 0 (X, empty, empty → no). Column 0 (X, empty, empty → no). Diagonal (only 0,0 → no). So no win. Then B places O at (1,1). Check row 1 (O, empty, empty → no). Column 1 (empty, O, empty → no). Check main diagonal (0,0 is X, 1,1 is O, 2,2 is empty → no). Check anti-diagonal (1,1 is part of anti-diagonal? r +c = 2 → 1+1=2? No, 1+1 is 2 → yes. So check anti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). The (1,1) is O, others are empty. So no. So no win. So after processing all moves (2), len(moves) is 2 <9 → return 'Pending'. Which matches example 4.So the code seems to handle these cases.Now, what about a case where a player wins on their third move, which is the fifth move overall. For example:moves = [[0,0], [1,0], [0,1], [1,1], [0,2]]So A's moves are 0,0; 0,1; 0,2 → creating a row 0 filled with X. The fifth move is index 4 (even), so player A. After placing X at (0,2), the row check for row 0 would be all X's → returns A.So code should return 'A' correctly.Another case: a diagonal win. For example, moves for A: [0,0], [1,1], [2,2]. Wait, but each A's move is every other move. So the moves list would be [ [0,0], (B move), [1,1], (B move), [2,2] ] → indexes 0 (A), 1 (B), 2 (A), 3 (B), 4 (A). So when A places at (2,2), the main diagonal is all X's. So code returns A.Yes.Now, what about when the winning move is the last possible move (9th move). For example, the grid is filled, and the ninth move is the winning move. Then, after processing that move, check for win. If yes, return the player, else return 'Draw'.So for example:moves = [ [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [2,1], [2,0], [0,2], [1,2], [2,2] ]This is 9 moves. The last move (index 8, even → A's turn). Suppose placing X at (2,2) completes a diagonal. Then, after placing, check and return 'A'. Otherwise, if no win, return 'Draw'.So code would check after the 9th move. If no win, then len(moves) is 9 → return 'Draw'.So the code correctly handles that.So the code seems solid.Now, code steps:- Initialize grid as 3x3 with ' '.- For each move in moves, process in order.- For each, determine player and symbol.- Place symbol.- Check row, column, and diagonals (if applicable).- If any check passes, return player.- After all moves, check if moves are 9 → draw, else pending.Thus, the code should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the given sequence of moves. The game is played by two players, A and B, who take turns placing their respective symbols ('X' for A and 'O' for B) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to check if either player has won by forming a line of three of their symbols, if the game ends in a draw, or if the game is still pending with more moves possible. Approach1. Grid Initialization: Create a 3x3 grid initialized with empty spaces to track the moves made by players A and B.2. Simulate Moves: Iterate through each move, placing 'X' for player A (on even indices) and 'O' for player B (on odd indices) in the grid.3. Check for Win: After each move, check if the current player has formed a winning line (row, column, or diagonal) with their symbol. If a win is detected, immediately return the winner.4.

Grid Initialization: The grid is a 3x3 list initialized with empty spaces to keep track of where each player has placed their symbols.2. Move Simulation: Each move in the input list is processed in order. Player A (using 'X') places their symbol on even-indexed moves, and Player B (using 'O') on odd-indexed moves.3. Win Check: After each move, the code checks if the current player has formed a winning line. This is done by checking the row, column, and both diagonals (if applicable) of the current move's position. If any of these checks confirm a line of three identical symbols, the respective player is declared the winner immediately.4. Game State Determination: If all moves are processed without a winner, the game state is determined based on the number of moves made. If all 9 moves are made, it's a draw; otherwise, the game is pending with more moves possible.This approach efficiently checks for a win after each move, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand."},{"problem":"Given an array arr of integers, check if there exists two integers N and M such that N is the double of M ( i.e. N = 2 * M).More formally check if there exists two indices i and j such that :i != j0 <= i, j < arr.lengtharr[i] == 2 * arr[j] Example 1:Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]Output: trueExplanation: N = 10 is the double of M = 5,that is, 10 = 2 * 5.Example 2:Input: arr = [7,1,14,11]Output: trueExplanation: N = 14 is the double of M = 7,that is, 14 = 2 * 7.Example 3:Input: arr = [3,1,7,11]Output: falseExplanation: In this case does not exist N and M, such that N = 2 * M. Constraints:2 <= arr.length <= 500-10^3 <= arr[i] <= 10^3","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function that checks if there are two elements in the array where one is double the other. Hmm. The examples given make sense. Like, in the first example, 10 is twice 5. And in the second, 14 is twice 7. So how do I approach this?First, I should probably look for every possible pair in the array and check if any satisfies N = 2*M. But wait, I need to make sure that the indices are different. Oh right, because even if there are two same elements, like two zeros, that would work since 0 is twice 0. So like if the array has a zero and another zero, then it should return true.Wait, the problem states that i and j must be different indices. So even if the same value is present twice, like two 5s, but 5*2 is 10, unless 10 is present, that's not a case. But for zero, 0*2 is 0, so if there are at least two zeros, then yes.So the approach could be to iterate through each element, and for each element, check if there's another element in the array that is either double of it or half of it. Wait, but how do I handle this efficiently?Let me think. For each element in the array, I can check if there exists another element that is exactly twice this element. But also, I need to check if the current element is twice any other element. Wait, maybe not. Because if element A is twice element B, then element B is half of element A. So perhaps for each element, I can check if there's another element that is either 2*current or current/2, but also ensuring that when dividing, the division is exact (i.e., no fractions). Wait, but since the array contains integers, the division must result in an integer. Hmm, but the array can have negative numbers as well. So for example, -4 and -2 would satisfy since -4 is twice -2.So, here's an idea: create a set of elements we have seen so far, and for each element in the array, check if either twice the element is in the set, or if the element is even and half of it is in the set. Wait, but maybe we need to process the array in a way where we look ahead. Alternatively, for each element, check all other elements to see if any of them satisfy the condition. But that would be O(n^2) time, which for n up to 500 is manageable. Let's see, 500*500 is 250,000 operations. That's acceptable.Alternatively, using a hash set can bring it down to O(n) time. Let's think. For each element in the array, before checking, we look into the set to see if there's a number that is twice the current element, or if the current element is even and there's a number that is half of it. If yes, return true. Otherwise, add the current element to the set. Wait, but this approach might not work if the elements are processed in the wrong order.Wait, for example, if the array is [5, 10]. Processing 5 first. The set is empty. So check if 5*2 is in the set (no) or 5/2 is in the set (2.5, which isn't). So add 5 to the set. Then process 10. Check if 10*2=20 is in the set (no) or 10/2=5 is in the set (yes). So returns true. That works. Similarly, if the array is [10,5], then when processing 10 first, check if 20 is in the set (no) or 5 is in the set (no). Add 10 to the set. Then process 5. Check if 10 is in the set (yes). So returns true. So the order doesn't matter here.But what about zeros? Suppose the array is [0,0]. Then for the second zero, when we check if there's 0*2 (0) in the set (which already has the first zero). So returns true. That's correct.But wait, in this approach, for each element, we check if either 2*element is present in the set (which would mean there's a previous element that is double of the current element, so that element would be N=2*M where M is current element). Or check if the element is even and element/2 is present (so that there's a previous element which is half of current, meaning current is double of that element). So in this way, by the time we process each element, the set contains elements that have been processed before. So for each element, we check if there's a previous element that is either twice this element or half of it (if even). This should cover all possibilities.But what about duplicates that come later? Like, if the array is [2, 4, 3]. When processing 2, the set is empty. Then add 2. Next element 4: check if 8 is in the set (no) or 4/2=2 is in the set (yes). So returns true. So works. If the array is [4, 2], then when processing 4: check if 8 (no) or 2 (no). Then add 4. Then process 2: check if 4 (yes, in the set). So returns true.So this approach seems to work. But why check both 2*element and element/2? Because the previous elements could be either the double or the half. Wait, let's see: for a current element, if there's an existing element that is twice as much, then the existing element is N and the current is M. But since the existing element was processed earlier, the current element is M, so N=2*M. Alternatively, if the existing element is half of the current, then the current element is N and the existing is M. So in this case, current is N, existing is M, so N=2*M. So in both cases, we need to check both possibilities.Wait, but in the first case (current element is M), we check if there's a 2*M in the set. In the second case (current element is N), we check if there's N/2 in the set. So for each element, checking if 2*element is present (so current is M, existing is N) or element is even and element/2 is present (so current is N, existing is M). That way, all possible pairs are considered.But why check if element is even in the second case? Because if the element is N=2*M, then M must be N/2, which must be an integer. So if the current element is N, then M must be N/2, which has to be an integer. So if the current element is odd, then N/2 would not be an integer, so such a pair is impossible. So in that case, we don't need to check for N/2 if the element is odd.So the algorithm would be:Initialize an empty set.For each num in arr:   if 2*num is in the set, or (num is even and num/2 is in the set):       return True   add num to the setIf the loop completes without returning, return False.Wait, but wait. Let's test this with some examples.Example 1: [10,2,5,3]Processing 10: set is empty. Check if 20 in set (no) or 10 is even (yes, 10/2=5. Is 5 in the set? No. So add 10 to set.Next num 2: check 2*2=4 (no) and 2 is even: 2/2=1 (no). Add 2.Next num 5: check 10 (yes, because 10 is in the set). So returns true. Correct.Example 2: [7,1,14,11]Processing 7: set empty. Check 14 (no) and 7/2=3.5 (not even). So add 7.Next 1: check 2 (no), 1 is even? 1/2=0.5 (not integer). So add 1.Next 14: check 28 (no) and 14 is even. 14/2=7. 7 is in the set. So returns true. Correct.Example 3: [3,1,7,11]Processing each element:3: check 6 (no) and 3 is odd. Add 3.1: check 2 (no), even? 0.5. No. Add 1.7: check 14 (no), even? 3.5. No. Add 7.11: check 22 (no), even? 5.5. No. Add 11. Loop ends, return false. Correct.Another test case: [0,0]. Processing first 0: check 0 (set is empty, no). Then add 0. Processing second 0: check 0 (yes, in set). So returns true.Another test case: [2,4]. Process 2 first. Check 4 (no). Add 2. Then 4: check 8 (no). Check 4/2=2 (yes). So returns true.Another test case: [-4, -2]. Processing -4: check -8 (no). Check if -4 is even: yes, -4/2 = -2. Is -2 in set? No. Add -4. Next element -2: check 2*-2 = -4. Is -4 in the set? Yes. So returns true. Correct.So this approach seems to work. Now, how to implement this in Python.The function will loop through each number in arr. For each number, it checks if 2*num is in the seen set, or if the number is even and num/2 is in the set. If either is true, return True. Otherwise, add the number to the set.Edge cases to consider: zero (as discussed), numbers with same elements (like two 5s?), but in that case, unless 10 is present, it's not a solution. Wait, for example [5,5], then when processing the second 5, check if 10 is in the set (no) and 5 is even? 5/2 is 2.5, not integer. So returns false. So that's correct. So in this case, there's no pair.But if there are two elements, 10 and 5, then it's correct. So the code works.So now, coding this:def checkIfExist(arr):    seen = set()    for num in arr:        if 2*num in seen or (num % 2 == 0 and num // 2 in seen):            return True        seen.add(num)    return FalseWait, but for the even check, we have to make sure that num is even. So (num % 2 == 0). Then, num/2 could be an integer. But in Python, using integer division. For example, if num is 10, 10//2 is 5. If num is -4, then -4//2 is -2, which is correct.Wait, but in Python, division with negative numbers using // rounds down. For example, -3 // 2 is -2. But in our case, when checking if num is even, division by 2 would be exact. So if the number is even, then num//2 is the exact division. So that's correct.So for example, num is 6: even, 6//2 is 3. Check if 3 is in the set.Yes.So the code should work.Let's test the [0,0] case. For the second zero, 2*0 is 0, which is in the set (the first zero was added). So returns True.Another case: [4, 2]. For the second element 2, 2*2 is 4. Is 4 in the seen set (yes, added after first element). So returns True.Another test case: [7,14]. Process 7 first: check 14 (no), 7 is even? No. Add 7. Then process 14: check 28 (no). 14 even: 7 is in the set. So returns True.All test cases pass. So this code should work.The constraints are acceptable. The time is O(n), space O(n).","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exist two distinct indices (i) and (j) in the given array such that the element at index (i) is exactly twice the element at index (j).

Let me read the problem again carefully. So, dominoes are equivalent if one can be rotated to match another. That means a domino [a, b] is the same as [b, a]. And I need to find all pairs (i,j) where i < j and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].Hmm. The first thing that comes to mind is that for each domino, I should normalize it so that equivalent dominoes have the same representation. Then, I can count how many times each normalized domino appears and compute the pairs based on that.Right, because if there are n dominoes that are the same after normalization, the number of pairs is combination(n, 2) which is n*(n-1)/2. So the approach would be to:1. Normalize each domino so that equivalent ones are stored the same way.2. Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each normalized domino.3. For each count in the dictionary, compute the combinations and sum them all.Now, how to normalize each domino? For a domino [a, b], if a <= b, keep it as (a, b). Otherwise, reverse it to (b, a). That way, two equivalent dominoes will have the same tuple. For example, [1,2] becomes (1,2), [2,1] becomes (1,2) as well. So this normalization step groups all equivalent dominoes together.So the steps for the code would be:- Initialize a dictionary, say counts, defaulting to 0.- For each domino in dominoes:   - Get a and b.   - If a > b, swap them to create the normalized tuple.   - Increment the count for this tuple in the dictionary.- Then, for each count in counts.values(), calculate the number of pairs and sum them.Wait, but how about the time complexity? The problem says dominoes.length can be up to 40000. So for 40k elements, this approach is O(n), which is acceptable. Because normalizing each domino is O(1), and then counting is O(n). Then, the combination part is also O(m), where m is the number of unique normalized dominoes, which is at most O(n) but in practice probably much less.Yes, that's manageable. So the code structure would look like:def numEquivDominoPairs(self, dominoes: List[List[int]]) -> int:    counts = defaultdict(int)    for a, b in dominoes:        key = (a, b) if a <= b else (b, a)        counts[key] += 1    total = 0    for c in counts.values():        if c >= 2:            total += c * (c - 1) // 2    return totalWait, but dominoes are given as lists. So when we loop through each domino, we can unpack a and b. But what if a domino is stored as a list with more than two elements? Well, the problem says each domino is [a, b], so each list has exactly two elements. So unpacking a, b is safe.Testing the example given: Input is [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]. After normalization, the first two become (1,2) and (1,2). The counts for (1,2) would be 2, (3,4) is 1, (5,6) is 1. Then, the pairs for (1,2) are 2*1/2=1. The others contribute 0. So output is 1. Which matches the example.Another test case: if there are three dominoes that normalize to the same key. Like [[1,2],[2,1],[1,2]]. Then counts would be 3. The pairs would be 3*2/2=3. So the answer would be 3.What about dominoes with the same numbers but already in order? Like [2,2], which stays (2,2). So all such dominoes would count towards the same key.What about edge cases, like dominoes of length 1? Then the count is 0, as there's no j > i possible.So this approach should handle all cases.Now, considering the constraints: dominoes[i][j] can be from 1 to 9. So each domino's elements are between 1 and 9. The normalized key can be any tuple where the first element is <= second. For example, (1,9), (2,3), etc. So possible keys are up to 9 + 8 + ... +1 = 45 possible combinations. Wait, actually, since for each pair (a,b) where a <= b, the number is (9 choose 2) + 9 (for pairs where a = b). 9*10/2=45 possible keys. So the counts dictionary can have at most 45 entries, but when dominoes have length 40000, the counts could be very large. But the combination calculation would handle that.Wait, no. The keys are all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a <= b. So for a in 1-9, and b >= a. So there's 9 possibilities for a=1 (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,9). For a=2, (2,2), ..., (2,9) which is 8, etc. So total is 9 + 8 + ... +1 = 45. So the counts dictionary can have at most 45 keys. So the loop over counts.values() is O(45), which is negligible.Thus, the code is efficient and works for the constraints.I think this should solve the problem correctly. Now, translating this into Python code as per the problem statement. The function is part of the Solution class, taking dominoes as a List[List[int]]. So the code as written earlier should work.Wait, but in Python, the division is using // for integer division. Yes, in the combination formula, c*(c-1)//2 is correct. Because for two elements, 2*1/2=1. So that's right.So the code should look like that. Let me write it properly with the required syntax.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalent domino pairs in a given list of dominoes. Two dominoes are considered equivalent if one can be rotated to match the other. The goal is to determine how many such pairs (i, j) exist where 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j]. Approach1. Normalization of Dominoes: For each domino, normalize it such that equivalent dominoes are represented identically. This is achieved by converting each domino into a tuple where the smaller number comes first. For example, both [1, 2] and [2, 1] are normalized to (1, 2).2. Counting Occurrences: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each normalized domino.3. Calculate Pairs: For each unique normalized domino, calculate the number of pairs using the combination formula C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2, where n is the count of occurrences of that domino. Sum these values to get the total number of equivalent pairs.

Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. Example 1:Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]Output: 4Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.Example 2:Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]Output: 12Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12. Constraints:0 <= nums.length <= 1000 <= nums[i] <= 400","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum amount of money a robber can steal without robbing adjacent houses. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let's understand the problem. The input is a list of numbers representing the money in each house. The robber can't rob two adjacent houses. So, for example, if the list is [1,2,3,1], the best is to take the first and third, which adds up to 4.Hmm. So how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem because each decision affects the next possible choices, and we need to find an optimal solution.Let me think about smaller examples. Let's say there's only one house. Then the answer is that house's value. If there are two houses, the robber picks the one with more money. For three houses, the robber can choose between robbing the first and third or the second. So the maximum would be max(nums[0] + nums[2], nums[1]).So for each house i, the robber has two choices: rob it or not. If he robs it, he can't rob i-1. So the maximum up to house i is the maximum of (current house's value + maximum up to i-2) or (maximum up to i-1).Ah, right. So this recurrence relation seems to hold. Let's formalize it. Let dp[i] be the maximum money that can be robbed up to house i. Then:dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])Base cases:dp[0] = nums[0]dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])Wait, but what if the list is empty? Then return 0. Also, if there's only one house, return nums[0].So the steps would be:1. Handle edge cases (empty list, 1 house).2. Initialize a dp array where each element represents the maximum up to that index.3. Iterate through the list, applying the recurrence relation.But using an array might take O(n) space. Is there a way to optimize space? Because if we only need the previous two values, we can just keep track of them with variables, not the entire array. That would reduce space complexity to O(1).Yes. Let's think. For each step i, we need dp[i-1] and dp[i-2]. So we can have variables like prev1 and prev2. Let's see.Let's say for the first house, prev2 = 0 (since before the first house, there's nothing), prev1 = nums[0]. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.Wait, maybe the variables can represent the maximum up to the previous house and the one before that. For example, when we're at house i, prev1 is the maximum up to i-1, prev2 is the maximum up to i-2. Then the current maximum would be max(prev1, prev2 + current). Then we update prev2 to be prev1, and prev1 becomes the new current maximum.So let's outline this approach:Initialize prev1 = 0, prev2 = 0.For each num in nums:    current = max(prev1, prev2 + num)    prev2 = prev1    prev1 = currentAt the end, return prev1.Wait, let's test this logic with example 1.Example 1: nums = [1,2,3,1]Initialize prev2 = 0, prev1 =0?Wait, maybe the initial values need to be adjusted. Let's see.Wait, when the first house is considered, the current should be max(0, 0 + 1) = 1. Then prev2 becomes 0, prev1 becomes 1.Second house: current = max(1, 0 + 2) = 2. So prev2 is 1, prev1 is 2.Third house: current = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4. prev2=2, prev1=4.Fourth house: current = max(4, 2 +1) =4. So the final result is 4. Which matches the example.Another example: [2,7,9,3,1]Let's step through.prev2=0, prev1=0.First house (2):current = max(0, 0+2)=2. prev2=0, prev1=2.Second house (7):current = max(2, 0+7)=7. prev2=2, prev1=7.Third house (9):current = max(7, 2+9=11) → 11. prev2=7, prev1=11.Fourth house (3):current = max(11, 7+3=10) → 11. prev2=11, prev1=11.Fifth house (1):current = max(11, 11 +1=12) →12. prev1 becomes 12. Return 12. Which is correct.So this approach works. So the code can be written with variables to track the previous two steps, updating them as we iterate through the nums array.Now, let's code this.But wait, what if nums is empty? We need to return 0. Also, if there's one element, return that.So the code would be something like:def rob(nums):    prev1, prev2 = 0, 0    for num in nums:        current = max(prev1, prev2 + num)        prev2 = prev1        prev1 = current    return prev1Wait, let's test for empty list. If nums is empty, the loop doesn't run, so return 0. That's correct.If nums is [5], the loop runs once. The first num is 5. current = max(0, 0+5) =5. prev2 becomes 0, prev1 becomes 5. return 5. Correct.Another test case: nums = [2,1,1,2]. The maximum is 4 (2+2). Let's see:prev2=0, prev1=0.First num 2: current = max(0,0+2=2) → prev2=0, prev1=2.Second num 1: current = max(2,0+1=1) → 2. prev2=2, prev1=2.Third num 1: current = max(2, 2+1=3) →3. prev2=2, prev1=3.Fourth num 2: current = max(3, 2+2=4) →4. So return 4. Correct.So this approach seems to work. So the code should be written as above.Therefore, the final Python function would be as described.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum amount of money a robber can steal from houses arranged in a street without alerting the police by robbing adjacent houses. This problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming with optimized space complexity. ApproachThe key insight is to recognize that the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the i-th house can be derived from the maximum amounts robbed up to the (i-1)-th and (i-2)-th houses. This leads us to the recurrence relation:- \`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])\`However, instead of maintaining an entire array to store these values, we can optimize space by keeping track of only the two previous values.

The record only contains the following three characters:'A' : Absent. 'L' : Late. 'P' : Present. A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).    You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.Example 1:Input: \\"PPALLP\\"Output: TrueExample 2:Input: \\"PPALLL\\"Output: False","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a student's attendance record is eligible for a reward based on certain conditions. Let's see the problem again. The conditions are that the student cannot have more than one 'A' (absent) and cannot have three or more consecutive 'L's (late). So I need to check both these conditions and return True if both are satisfied, else False.Hmm. Let's break this down. The first condition is straightforward: count the number of 'A's in the string. If the count is more than 1, return False. The second condition is about consecutive 'L's. So I need to check if there are three 'L's in a row anywhere in the string.How do I approach checking for consecutive 'L's? Well, I can iterate through the string and track the current streak of 'L's. Whenever I encounter an 'L', I increment the current streak, and if it reaches 3, I return False. If the character is not 'L', I reset the streak to 0.Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Like, for the entire string, check if 'LLL' is a substring. If it is present, then return False. That's a simpler approach. So checking if 'LLL' is in the string. That's a good idea. Because if there are three consecutive 'L's, the substring 'LLL' will be present. So that part can be checked with a simple substring check.So the two main checks are:1. The count of 'A's in the string is less than 2.2. The string does not contain 'LLL' as a substring.If both conditions are true, then return True; else, False.Let me test this logic against the examples.Example 1: Input: \\"PPALLP\\"Count of 'A's: 1. So that's okay. Does it have 'LLL'? Let's see the string: PPALLP. The substring 'LL' is present but not 'LLL', so condition 2 is satisfied. So output is True. Which matches the example.Example 2: Input: \\"PPALLL\\"Count of 'A's is 1. So that's okay. But the substring 'LLL' is present. So condition 2 fails. Hence, output is False. Which matches the example.Another test case: \\"AA\\" would have two 'A's. So condition 1 fails. So return False.Another case: \\"ALL\\". Let's see. 'A' count is 1. But the string has 'LLL'? No, the string is 'ALL' which is A followed by two L's. So no three consecutive L's. So the conditions are met. So output is True.Wait, wait, no. 'ALL' is A followed by two Ls. So three consecutive Ls? No. So condition 2 is okay. So output is True.Another test case: 'LLL' would have three Ls. So condition 2 fails, so output is False.Another case: 'PLLPLLALP' — here, if there are three Ls anywhere? Let's see: 'LL' and then another 'LL' later. So no three in a row. So condition 2 is okay. But if there's one 'A', then all conditions are met.So the logic seems solid.So the steps for the function would be:- Check if the number of 'A's in s is greater than 1. If yes, return False.- Check if 'LLL' is a substring of s. If yes, return False.- Else, return True.That's pretty straightforward.Now, how to implement this in Python.The function is part of a class Solution. The method is called checkRecord, takes a string s and returns a boolean.So code steps:def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:    # count 'A's    a_count = s.count('A')    if a_count > 1:        return False    # check for 'LLL' in s    if 'LLL' in s:        return False    return TrueWait, that's it? That seems too simple, but according to the logic, yes.Let me test this code with the examples.Example 1: 'PPALLP' → A count is 1. No 'LLL'. Returns True. Correct.Example 2: 'PPALLL' → A count 1. 'LLL' is present. Returns False. Correct.Another test case: 'AA' → a_count is 2 → return False. Correct.Another test case: 'ALL' → a_count 1, no 'LLL' → returns True. Correct.Another test case: 'LALL' → a_count is 1. Does it have 'LLL'? Let's see the string: 'LALL' → positions 0 is L, 1 is A, 2 is L, 3 is L. So no three in a row.

I need to write a Python function to replace all the '?' characters in a string such that there are no consecutive repeating characters. The original non-'?' characters can't be changed. Hmm. So the problem is about handling the '?'s and replacing them with some letter that's different from their neighbors.Let me think. For each '?', I need to find a character that's not the same as the previous and next characters. But wait, how do I handle cases where the '?' is at the beginning or end of the string? Like, if the '?' is the first character, it only has a next character to check. Similarly for the last.So the approach might be: iterate through each character in the string. When a '?' is found, look at the previous character (if it exists) and the next character (if it exists). Then choose a character that's not equal to either of those. Also, if there are multiple choices, any is fine. So maybe for each '?', try to pick the smallest possible letter that's not conflicting with the neighbors.Wait, but how do we handle cases where the previous or next is also a '?', which might have been replaced already? Oh right, because when processing the string, we can replace each '?' in order, and once replaced, the new character is part of the string. So for example, if we have \\"??\\", the first '?' is replaced with a character, say 'a', and then the next '?' must be replaced with something that's not 'a'.So the key is to process each '?' in the string, replacing it with a character that doesn't conflict with the already existing characters (either original or already replaced ones).So the plan is:1. Convert the string into a list for easier manipulation, since strings are immutable in Python.2. Iterate over each character in the list.3. When a '?' is found, check the previous and next characters (if they exist).4. Choose a character (from a to z) that is not equal to the previous or next.5. Replace the '?' with that character.But how to choose the character? Let's think. For each '?', the available characters are those not equal to the left and right. So, for example, if the left is 'a' and the right is 'c', then the possible choices are any letter except 'a' and 'c'. If there are multiple options, we can pick any. Like in example 1, \\"?zs\\", the left is nothing (so check right, which is 'z'), so the first character can be any except 'z', so 'a' is chosen (but the example output uses 'a', but any except 'z' is acceptable).So the algorithm for each '?' would be:- Determine the left character (if position > 0)- Determine the right character (if position < len(s)-1)- Find a character in 'a' to 'z' that is not equal to left or right.- Assign that character to the current position.But how do we find such a character? Let's think. For example, possible letters are a-z. We can loop through the letters and pick the first one that is not in {left, right}.Wait, but left and right could be the same. Or maybe not. Wait, the original string (excluding '?') has no consecutive repeats, but after replacing '?', we need to ensure that no consecutive repeats. So for each '?', we have to make sure that the new character is different from the previous character (if any) and the next character (if any).Wait, but the next character could be a '?' which will be replaced later. So when replacing a '?', the next character might still be a '?', but in that case, we only need to consider the next character if it's not a '?', right? Because if the next is a '?', it will be handled in a subsequent step. Wait, no. Because when we process the current '?', the next '?' is still part of the list. So for example, if we have \\"a??b\\", when processing the first '?', the next character is '?', which hasn't been replaced yet. So the next character is '?', which is not a letter. So when replacing the first '?', we only need to check the previous (which is 'a') and the next (which is '?', but since it's not a letter yet, maybe we can ignore it for the current replacement? Wait, but when replacing the first '?', the next character is '?', but when that next '?' is processed, it will check the previous character (the one we just replaced) and the next character (if any). So for the current replacement, the next character (being '?') is not a problem, because we can choose a character that's different from the previous and the next non-'?' characters.Wait, perhaps the way to handle this is: for each '?', when replacing it, we only need to consider the characters that are already fixed (non-'?') and the ones we have already processed. Because when replacing a '?', the ones after it might still be '?', but those will be handled in later steps. So for example:Original: \\"a??b\\"Process first '?':Left is 'a', next is '?'. So we need to choose a character different from 'a' (the left). The right is '?', which hasn't been replaced yet, so it's a '?', so we can ignore it. So pick a character not equal to 'a'. Let's choose 'c'. Then the string becomes \\"ac?b\\".Now process the next '?': left is 'c', next is 'b'. So choose a character not equal to 'c' or 'b', like 'a'. So the final string is \\"acab\\". Wait, but that has consecutive 'c' and 'a'? Wait, no. The first 'c' is followed by 'a', which is okay. The 'a' is followed by 'b', which is also okay. So that's valid.So the key is, when processing a '?', the next characters that are also '?' are not a problem because they will be handled later, and when they are processed, their previous character (the one we replaced now) will be considered.So, for each '?', we need to look at the previous character (already processed) and the next character (if it's not a '?'). Wait, no. For example, if the next character is a '?', then we can't know what it will be replaced with. But when we process the current '?', the next character is a '?', which hasn't been replaced yet. So the current replacement only needs to avoid the previous character and the next character if it's not a '?'. Because the next '?' will be replaced later, and at that time, it will check against the current replacement.So, the steps for replacing a '?' at position i:- Check left character (i-1) if i > 0. It's possible that s[i-1] is not a '?', because we process the string left to right. So any '?' to the left of the current position would have been replaced already. So s[i-1] is either a letter or a '?', but if we process left to right, then if i-1 was a '?', we would have replaced it already. Wait, no. Because in the initial pass, the list is being processed in order. So for example, if the original string is \\"??\\", when processing the first '?', the next character is a '?', which hasn't been replaced yet. So when replacing the first '?', the left is nothing (if it's the first character), and the next is a '?', which hasn't been replaced. So in that case, the first '?' can be replaced with any character (since no left neighbor). Then the next '?' will check the left (the first replaced character) and the right (if any). So the key is: when processing the current '?', the left neighbor is already processed (if exists), and the right neighbor may be a '?' or a letter. If it's a letter, then the current replacement must not be equal to it. If it's a '?', then the right neighbor's replacement will be handled later, and when it's processed, it will check against the current replacement.Therefore, when replacing a '?' at position i, the left character (i-1) is already a non-'?' character (since we process left to right). Because if i-1 was a '?', it was processed earlier. Wait, no. Suppose the string is \\"???\\". We process from left to right. The first '?' is replaced with, say, 'a'. Then the second '?' is next. At that point, the left is 'a' (replaced), and the right is the third '?', which is still a '?'. So when replacing the second '?', we need to choose a character different from 'a' (the left), and the right is a '?', so we can ignore the right. Then the third '?' would be processed, left is the second replaced character, right is nothing, so choose a character different from the left.So the algorithm for each '?' is:For position i:left = s[i-1] if i > 0 else Noneright = s[i+1] if i < len(s)-1 else NoneWe need to choose a character that is not equal to left and right. But if right is a '?', then we can ignore it, because when we process the right '?', we will check against the current replacement. But wait, the current replacement will affect the right '?'. For example, if we have \\"a?c\\", and the middle is a '?'. When replacing the middle, the left is 'a', the right is 'c', so the middle must be a character that is not 'a' nor 'c'. So 'b' is chosen, resulting in \\"abc\\", which is valid.But in a scenario where the right is a '?', like \\"a??\\", the first '?' is replaced with 'b', then the next '?' must be replaced with something that is not 'b'. So when processing the first '?', the left is 'a', the right is '?', which is not processed yet. So the first '?' can be replaced with any character except 'a'. Let's choose 'b'. Then the next '?' has left 'b' and right is None (since it's the last character). So replace with 'a' (since it's not 'b').So the key is, when replacing a '?', we only need to check the left character (which has already been processed and is not a '?') and the right character (if it's not a '?'). Because if the right is a '?', then when we process it, we'll check against the current replacement. So the current replacement must not clash with the left, and not clash with the right (if the right is a letter). But if the right is a '?', then the current replacement can ignore the right (since the right will be processed later, and when replaced, it will check against the current replacement).Wait, but what if the right is a '?', but when we process the current '?', the right is a '?', but after replacing current, then the next '?' will have to check against current's replacement and possibly the next next character. So the current replacement's right is a '?', which will be handled in the next steps. So in this case, when replacing current, the right is a '?', so we can ignore it. So the current replacement only needs to check the left and the right (if it's not a '?').So the steps for replacing a '?' at position i:1. Check left character (if exists and is not '?'). So since we're processing left to right, the left character (i-1) is already processed, so it's not a '?'.Wait, no. For example, in the original string \\"?a?\\", the first character is '?', and the third is '?'. When processing the first '?', the left is none, the right is 'a'. So we need to choose a character that's not 'a'. Then when processing the third '?', the left is 'a', and the right is none. So choose a character not 'a'.So in the case of \\"???\\", processing left to right:First '?': left is none, right is '?', so choose a character (e.g., 'a').Second '?': left is 'a', right is '?', so choose a character not 'a' (e.g., 'b').Third '?': left is 'b', right is none, choose a character not 'b' (e.g., 'c').Result is 'abc' which is valid.So when replacing a '?', the right character (if it's a '?') can be ignored because it's going to be replaced later, and when it is replaced, it will check against the current character.Therefore, for each '?' in the string, when processing it, the only constraints are:- The character must be different from the left (if left exists)- The character must be different from the right (if right exists and is not a '?')But if the right is a '?', then when we process the current '?', the right is a '?', which is going to be replaced later, so we don't need to worry about it. Because when that '?' is processed, it will check against the current character (which is now a letter) and its own right (if any). So the current replacement doesn't need to check against a right '?'.So, the algorithm is:For each character in the string:If it's a '?', look at the previous character (if any) and the next character (if it's not a '?'). Then choose a character that is not equal to either of those.So how to implement this?We can loop through each character in the string. When we encounter a '?', we need to replace it. The left is s[i-1] if i > 0. The right is s[i+1] if i < len(s)-1 and s[i+1] != '?'. Then, find a character that is not equal to left or right. If right is '?', then ignore the right (since it's going to be handled later).Wait, but in the example where the current '?' is followed by a '?', then the current replacement can be any character not equal to left. Because the next '?' will check against the current replacement and its next character (if any). So in that case, when replacing the current '?', we only need to check the left (if exists) and the next character (if it's not a '?'). So the right is only considered if it's not a '?'.So, in code:for each index i in the string:    if s[i] is '?':        left_char = s[i-1] if i > 0 else None        right_char = s[i+1] if (i+1 < len(s)) and (s[i+1] != '?') else None        for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':            if c != left_char and c != right_char:                replace s[i] with c                breakSo that's the approach. Now, let's test this logic against the examples.Example 1: \\"?zs\\"Processing the first character, which is '?'.left_char is None (since i=0).right_char is 'z' (i+1 is 1, which is 'z').So need to choose a character not 'z'. So 'a' is chosen. So the result is 'azs'.Which matches the example.Example 2: \\"ubv?w\\"The '?' is at index 3.left_char is 'v' (i=3-1=2, which is 'v').right_char is 'w' (i+1=4, which is 'w').So the replacement must be different from 'v' and 'w'. So possible letters are a, b, c, ..., u, x, y, z. So the first in the list is 'a', but in the example output, it's 'a'. So that's correct.But in the example, the output is 'ubvaw'. Wait, the '?' is replaced with 'a'. So that's correct.Example 3: \\"j?qg??b\\"Original string: j ? q g ? ? bProcessing each '?' in order:First '?' is at index 1.Left_char is 'j' (index 0), right_char is 'q' (index 2, not a '?').So need a character not 'j' or 'q'. Let's choose 'a'. So the string becomes 'jaqg??b'.Next, the next '?' is at index 4. Left_char is 'g' (index3). Right_char is '?', so ignore it. So choose a character not 'g'. Let's say 'a' is allowed. Wait, but then the next '?' is at index5. Left_char is 'a' (from index4), so must choose a character not 'a' and right_char is 'b' (since index5+1 is 6, which is 'b' and not a '?'). So for index5: left is 'a', right is 'b'. So the replacement must be not 'a' or 'b'. So for example, 'c'.So the string becomes 'jaqga?b' → then index4 is 'a', index5 is 'c', so 'jaqgacb'.But in the example, the output is \\"jaqgacb\\". Wait, but the example's input is \\"j?qg??b\\" and the output is \\"jaqgacb\\".So the code would process as follows:Index 1: replace with 'a' (not 'j' or 'q').Then index4: replace with a character not 'g' (since left is 'g' at index3) and right is '?', which is ignored. So possible choices: 'a' (not 'g'). So index4 becomes 'a'.Then index5: replace with a character not 'a' (left) and right is 'b' (index6). So possible letters: c, d, etc. Choose 'c', so index5 becomes 'c'. So the final string is 'jaqgacb', which matches the example.So this logic seems to work.Another example: \\"??yw?ipkj?\\"Original string: ? ? y w ? i p k j ?Processing each '?' in order:First '?', index 0. Left is None, right is index1, which is '?'. So right_char is '?', so ignore. So can choose any character except left (none) and right (ignored). So pick 'a'.Then index1: left is 'a' (from index0), right is 'y' (index2). So need to pick a character not 'a' or 'y'. Let's choose 'c'.So string becomes 'ac y w ? i p k j ?'.Next, index4 (the fourth character is '?'). Left is 'w' (index3), right is 'i' (index5). So need a character not 'w' or 'i'. Let's pick 'a'.So index4 becomes 'a'.Now the next '?' is at index9 (last character). Left is 'j' (index8). Right is None. So choose a character not 'j', like 'a'.So the final string is 'acywaipkja', which matches the example.So the algorithm works.Now, how to implement this in Python.The steps:Convert the string to a list, since strings are immutable.Loop through each character:for i in range(len(s_list)):    if s_list[i] == '?':        left_char = s_list[i-1] if i > 0 else None        # For right_char, check if i+1 is within range and not '?'        right_char = None        if i + 1 < len(s_list):            if s_list[i+1] != '?':                right_char = s_list[i+1]            else:                right_char = None        else:            right_char = None        # Now, find a character in a-z that is not left_char or right_char        for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':            if c != left_char and c != right_char:                s_list[i] = c                breakReturn ''.join(s_list)But wait, in the code above, when the next character is '?', right_char is set to None. So when replacing, we only check left_char and right_char (which is None in that case). So the code works.But let's test the code for a case where the next character is a '?'.For example, \\"a??b\\".Original list: ['a', '?', '?', 'b']Processing index1:left_char is 'a', right_char is '?', so right_char is None.So find a character not 'a' (left_char). So 'b' is allowed. So replace index1 with 'b'.Then, index2: left_char is 'b', right_char is 'b' (since i+1 is 3, which is 'b'). So replace with a character not 'b' (left) and not 'b' (right). So choose 'a'.Result is 'abab'.Which is valid.So code works.Another test case: \\"???\\"Processing first '?', left is None, right is '?', so right_char is None. So pick 'a'.Then index1: left is 'a', right is '?', so right_char is None. Choose 'b'.Index2: left is 'b', right is None. Choose 'c'.Result 'abc' which is valid.So the code should work.Now, implementing this.The function will be part of the Solution class.So the code:class Solution:    def modifyString(self, s: str) -> str:        s_list = list(s)        n = len(s_list)        for i in range(n):            if s_list[i] == '?':                # Determine left and right characters                left = s_list[i-1] if i > 0 else None                right = None                if i + 1 < n:                    if s_list[i+1] != '?':                        right = s_list[i+1]                # Find a suitable replacement                for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':                    if c != left and c != right:                        s_list[i] = c                        break        return ''.join(s_list)Testing this code.Let's test example 3: \\"j?qg??b\\"s_list becomes ['j','?','q','g','?','?','b']Processing i=1:left = 'j', right is 'q' (since i+1=2 is 'q', which is not '?'. So right is 'q'.Looking for c in a-z not 'j' or 'q'. The first is 'a' → replace with 'a'.Now s_list is ['j','a','q','g','?','?','b'].Processing i=4 (current character is '?'):left is 'g', i+1=5 is '?', so right is None.Find a character not 'g'. First is 'a', so replace with 'a'.Now s_list[4] = 'a'.Processing i=5: left is 'a', i+1=6 is 'b', not '?', so right is 'b'.Find a character not 'a' or 'b'. First is 'c', so replace with 'c'.Result is \\"jaqgacb\\", which matches the example.Another example: input \\"??yw?ipkj?\\"Processing:Original list is ['?', '?', 'y', 'w', '?', 'i', 'p', 'k', 'j', '?'].i=0:left is None. right is '?', so right is None (since i+1=1 is '?').Choose 'a'.i=1: left is 'a', right is 'y' (i+1=2, which is 'y'). So replace with any not 'a' or 'y'. 'b' is allowed. Wait, but the first in the list is 'a', but it's skipped. Let's see:Looking for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':Check 'a' → equals left (a). Skip.Check 'b' → not a or y. So replace with 'b'? But in the example, the output is 'acywaipkja'. Wait, perhaps in the code, the replacement for i=1 is 'c'?Wait, let's see. For the example input \\"??yw?ipkj?\\".After replacing index0 with 'a', index1 is next.i=1: left is 'a', right is 'y' (since s[i+1] is 'y', not '?'). So the code will look for the first character in 'abc...' that is not 'a' or 'y'.The first character is 'a' → skip. Next 'b' → not 'a' or 'y' → yes. So replace with 'b'? But the example output is 'acywaipkja', which for index1 is 'c'.Hmm, this suggests that the code as written may not produce the example output, but the problem allows any valid answer. So even if the code chooses 'b' instead of 'c', it's still a valid solution. The example's output is just one possible solution.But in the example, the first two '?'s are replaced with 'a' and 'c' respectively. So why does the code choose 'c'?Wait, because in the code, when processing i=1, the code checks the characters in order 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. So for left 'a' and right 'y', 'a' is equal to left → skip. 'b' is not, so it's chosen. So the code would replace index1 with 'b', leading to 'ab...', but the example's output is 'ac...'.Ah, but this indicates that the code may return a different valid solution. However, the problem states that any valid solution is acceptable. So the code is correct as long as the output is valid, even if it's different from the example.But why does the example output have 'c' as the second character?Because there are multiple valid solutions, and the code's approach picks the first possible character in the 'abc' order.So in the example's case, perhaps the code would return 'ab...', but the example's answer is 'ac...', which is also valid.Thus, the code is correct, even if it doesn't match the example's exact output. Because any valid answer is acceptable.So the code is correct.Therefore, the function should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to convert all '?' characters in a given string into lowercase letters such that the resulting string contains no consecutive repeating characters. The solution must ensure that the non '?' characters are not modified and that the resulting string is valid. Approach1. Convert the String to a List: Since strings in Python are immutable, we convert the input string into a list to allow in-place modifications.2. Iterate Through Each Character: For each character in the list, check if it is a '?'.3. Determine Neighboring Characters: For each '?', check the previous character (if it exists) and the next character (if it exists and is not a '?').4. Find a Suitable Replacement: Replace the '?' with the first lowercase letter that is different from both the previous and next characters. This ensures no consecutive repeating characters.

Replacement Logic: We iterate through the alphabet from 'a' to 'z' and select the first character that does not match either the left or right neighbor, ensuring no consecutive duplicates.This approach ensures that each '?' is replaced efficiently and correctly, resulting in a valid string with no consecutive repeating characters.

So the problem is, given a non-negative integer x, find the largest integer y such that y squared is less than or equal to x. And then return y. Hmm, how do I approach this? Let's think. The examples show that for 4 it's 2, and for 8 it's 2 because the actual square root is 2.828..., so we truncate. So the key is to find the maximum y where y² ≤ x.First, what's the straightforward way? Well, starting from 0 and incrementing until y squared exceeds x. But that's O(sqrt(x)) time, which for large x (like up to 2^31 -1) would be too slow. So for very large x, this approach isn't feasible. So we need a more efficient method.Binary search comes to mind. Because the possible values of y are in a sorted order. Let's say the possible y is between 0 and x. Wait, but actually, the square root of x can't be more than x/2 when x is greater than 1. Wait, no. Wait, for x=2, sqrt is about 1.414. For x=4, it's 2 which is x/2. Wait, maybe the upper bound can be set to x, but that's not tight. For example, for x=16, the sqrt is 4, which is x/4. So maybe the upper bound can be x, but perhaps even better to set it to x//2 +1 or something. Let me think. For x=1, sqrt is 1. So perhaps the upper bound can be x. But for binary search, even if the upper is x, the number of steps is logarithmic, so it's manageable.So binary search between low=0 and high=x. Then, in each step, compute mid = (low + high) // 2. Then compare mid^2 with x. If mid^2 <= x, then maybe we can go higher. But wait, the exact condition depends on whether there's a higher y that still satisfies y² ≤x. So the idea is to find the largest y such that y² ≤x.So during binary search, if mid^2 is less than or equal to x, then we can move the low up to mid +1, but keep track of the possible answer. Wait, maybe another approach: binary search to find the first element where mid^2 is greater than x. Then the answer is that position minus one. Or adjust the binary search steps accordingly.Alternatively, the loop can track the possible candidates, narrowing down the range until low exceeds high, and then return high as the answer.Let me think through an example. Take x=8.We start with low=0, high=8.mid = (0+8)//2 =4. 4²=16>8. So we set high=3.Next iteration: low=0, high=3. mid=1. 1²=1 <=8. So set low=2.mid=(2+3)//2=2. 2²=4 <=8. Set low=3.Now low=3, high=3. mid=3. 3²=9>8. So set high=2. Now low>high. The loop ends. The result is high, which is 2. Which is correct.Another example: x=4.low=0, high=4. mid=2. 2²=4 ==4. So maybe check if we can go higher. But since 4 is exactly x, the answer is 2. But how does the loop proceed here? Let's see:mid=2, 2²=4. So since we are looking for the largest y where y²<=4, we can consider if there's a larger y. So set low=mid+1. Then low=3, high=4. mid=(3+4)/2=3.5 → 3 in integer division. 3²=9>4. So set high=2. Now loop ends. So high is 2, which is correct.So the binary search approach works here.So the steps for binary search are:Initialize low = 0, high = x.While low <= high:   mid = (low + high) // 2   mid_squared = mid * mid   if mid_squared == x:       return mid   elif mid_squared < x:       low = mid + 1   else:       high = mid -1After the loop ends, return high.Because when the loop exits, high is the largest integer where high^2 <=x.Let me test this logic with x=8:As before, loop ends with high=2. Correct.Another test case: x=1.low=0, high=1. mid=0.5 → 0. 0^2=0 <1. So low becomes 1. Now mid is (1+1)//2=1. 1²=1 ==x. Return 1. Correct.Another case: x=2.low=0, high=2.mid=1: 1<=2 → low=2.mid=(2+2)/2=2. 2²=4>2. So high=1. Loop ends. Return 1. Correct.So this logic seems to work.But wait, what about when mid*mid could be larger than x? For example, x=5.Possible square roots: 2^2=4, 3^2=9. So answer is 2.Let's see:low=0, high=5.mid=2. 4 <=5 → low=3.mid=(3+5)/2=4. 16>5 → high=3.Now low=3, high=3. mid=3. 9>5 → high=2.Loop ends. Return 2. Correct.So the logic works here.So the binary search approach seems valid.Now, in Python, the function is part of a class Solution. So the method is def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:But what about when x is 0? Let's test x=0.low=0, high=0. mid=0. 0²=0 → return 0. Correct.Another edge case: x=3. Answer is 1.Yes, binary search would proceed as:low=0, high=3.mid=1: 1<=3 → low=2.mid=2+3//2 = 2.5 → 2. mid=2. 4>3 → high=1. Loop ends. Return 1. Correct.So this approach handles all cases.So the code would look like:class Solution:    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:        low = 0        high = x        while low <= high:            mid = (low + high) // 2            mid_squared = mid * mid            if mid_squared == x:                return mid            elif mid_squared < x:                low = mid + 1            else:                high = mid -1        return highBut wait, what about when x is very large, like 2^31 -1. Then mid*mid could overflow? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. So this code should handle all x correctly.Another thing to consider: mid * mid could be a very big number, but in Python, that's okay.Testing for x=8, returns 2, which is correct.Yes.So this should be the correct approach.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to compute the integer square root of a non-negative integer ( x ).

This method is chosen because the possible values of ( y ) (the square root) form a sorted sequence, allowing us to leverage the logarithmic time complexity of binary search.

These pointers define the range within which we search for the integer square root.2.

Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.So the problem says that after deleting some columns, each remaining column should be in non-decreasing order. And I need to find the minimum number of deletions. So the goal is to maximize the number of columns we can keep, provided they are all sorted in non-decreasing order. Oh right, because the minimum deletions would be the total columns minus the maximum kept that satisfy the condition.Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than trying all possible combinations. Let's think about the example given. Like in example 1, the columns are:Original columns are:0: c, d, g → which is sorted.1: b, a, h → not sorted.2: a, f, i → sorted.So when you delete column 1, the remaining columns 0 and 2 are both sorted. So the answer is 1.So the approach is to check each column in order and decide whether to keep it or not. But how do we model this?Wait, maybe we can model it as a problem where we select columns such that each selected column is non-decreasing, and also, when considering the order of columns, the selection must ensure that all columns are non-decreasing when compared to each other. Wait, no. Wait, the columns are independent of each other. Wait, no. Wait, the columns are the remaining ones after deletion. So the columns are the original columns but with some indices removed. So the order of the columns is preserved. For example, if the original columns are 0,1,2 and we delete column 1, the remaining columns are 0 and 2, in that order. But each of those individual columns must be non-decreasing.Ah right. So each individual column (after deletion) must be non-decreasing. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of columns we can keep such that each of those columns is non-decreasing. Then the answer is the total columns minus that maximum. But how do we find the maximum number of columns to keep, considering that they can be any subset (but in order) of the original columns, as long as each is non-decreasing.Wait, but in the example 1, the columns 0 and 2 are both non-decreasing, so we can keep both. So the maximum number of columns to keep is 2, and total columns is 3. So 3-2=1 deletion. Which matches the example.So the problem becomes: find the maximum subset of columns (in their original order) such that each column in the subset is non-decreasing. Then the answer is total columns minus the size of this subset.But how do I compute that maximum subset?This sounds similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. Wait, but in LIS, we look for a subsequence in a sequence that is increasing. Here, each element is a column, and the sequence of columns must be such that each individual column is non-decreasing. But the order of the columns is preserved. So the maximum subset is simply the count of all columns that are non-decreasing. Because if a column is non-decreasing, we can include it. Wait, no. Because there's no dependency between the columns. For example, suppose some columns are non-decreasing. We can include any subset of those columns, regardless of their order. Wait, but the columns must be kept in their original order. So the subset of columns must be a sequence of columns that appear in the original order, and each of them is non-decreasing. So the maximum such subset is the maximum number of columns where each is non-decreasing. But that's not correct. Because suppose some columns are not non-decreasing, but others are. So the answer is to count all columns that are non-decreasing. Because including all such columns would be the maximum possible. Because there's no order constraint between the columns. Wait, but the columns are arranged in their original positions. So, for example, if column 0 is non-decreasing, and column 2 is non-decreasing, then we can include both, even if column 1 is not. So the maximum number of columns is the count of all columns that are non-decreasing. Because those can be included, and the others are deleted. But wait, that's not the case. Let's think of an example.Suppose the columns are:Column 0: [a, b] → sorted.Column 1: [c, a] → not sorted.Column 2: [d, c] → not sorted.So the maximum number of columns is 1 (just column 0). So the answer is 3 -1 =2.But if columns 0 and 2 are both sorted, but column 1 is not, then we can include both 0 and 2, giving 2 columns, so deletions are 1. So the problem is that the columns can be any subset, as long as each is sorted.Ah! So the problem is not to select columns that form a sequence where each column is non-decreasing, but to select any subset of columns (in their original order) where each individual column is non-decreasing. So the maximum possible is the number of columns that are themselves non-decreasing, regardless of their order. Because the columns are kept in their original order, but any subset of them can be selected as long as each is non-decreasing.So the problem reduces to counting how many columns are already non-decreasing. The answer is then the total columns minus that count.Wait, but that's not correct. Let's see.Wait, in example 1, the original columns are:Column 0: c, d, g → sorted.Column 1: b, a, h → not sorted.Column 2: a, f, i → sorted.So the count of non-decreasing columns is 2. So the answer is 3-2=1. Which matches the example.In example 3, all columns are not sorted. So the count is 0, answer is 3-0=3. Which matches.In example 2, the columns are:Each column has one character. So each column is trivially non-decreasing. So for A = [\\"a\\",\\"b\\"], each column (there's only one) is sorted. So answer is 0.So in this case, the approach is to check for each column whether it is non-decreasing. Then the number of non-decreasing columns is the maximum possible, and the answer is total columns minus that number.Wait, but this seems too simple. Let's think of a case where a column is non-decreasing, but if we delete some previous columns, would that affect the current column's status? Because the deletion of columns is done by indices. So when we delete a column, the remaining columns are the ones not in the deletion set. So the order of the remaining columns is the same as the original, but with some indices removed. However, the individual columns are checked in their original form. For example, in example 1, after deleting column 1, the remaining columns are 0 and 2. Each of those columns is checked for non-decreasing in their original form. Because deletion is done by index, and the characters in the strings are deleted in those indices. So the remaining columns are the original columns (indices) that are not deleted.Wait, no. Wait, when you delete the columns (indices) from all strings, the remaining characters form the new strings. The remaining columns are the original columns that were not deleted. For example, if original columns are 0,1,2 and you delete 1, then the new columns are 0 and 2, which are the original 0 and 2 columns. So each of these must be non-decreasing in the original array.So the process is: for each column in the original array, check if it is non-decreasing. The set of columns that can be kept is exactly those that are non-decreasing. Because if a column is not non-decreasing, keeping it would violate the condition. So the maximum number of columns we can keep is the number of columns that are non-decreasing. Hence, the answer is total columns minus that number.Wait, but this can't be right. Let's take a counterexample. Suppose we have the following columns:Column 0: a, b → sorted.Column 1: c, a → not sorted.Column 2: d, e → sorted.If we keep columns 0 and 2, that's two columns. So the answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.But what if a column is sorted, but after deleting some columns before it, the characters in the column change? No, because deleting columns (indices) affects the strings by removing the characters at those indices. For example, if the original strings are \\"abc\\", \\"def\\", and we delete column 0, then the remaining strings are \\"bc\\", \\"ef\\". The remaining columns (indices 1 and 2) are the original columns 1 and 2. So their characters are the same as before. So checking whether a column is non-decreasing in the original array is sufficient, regardless of other columns. Because the deletions don't affect the characters in the remaining columns. Thus, the approach is to count all the columns that are non-decreasing in the original array. The answer is total columns minus that count.So the problem reduces to checking each column in the original array, count how many are non-decreasing. The minimum deletions is the total columns minus that count.Wait, this seems correct. Let's test with the examples.Example 1: The non-decreasing columns are 0 and 2. So 2, total 3. Deletions 1. Correct.Example 2: Only one column, which is [\\"a\\", \\"b\\"] → sorted. So deletions 0. Correct.Example 3: All columns are not sorted. So deletions 3. Correct.Another example: suppose there's a column that is not sorted, but after deleting some other columns, it's sorted. Wait, no. Because deleting other columns (indices) does not affect this column's characters. For example, if column 1 is not sorted in the original array, then even after deleting column 0, column 1 is still not sorted. Because the characters in column 1 are the same as before. So the approach of checking each column in the original array is correct.Therefore, the solution is to iterate through each column, check if it is non-decreasing, count how many such columns there are, subtract from the total columns.So the steps are:1. For each column in the original array (from 0 to length-1 of the strings):   a. Check if the column is non-decreasing. That is, for each row in the array, the current character is <= the next character in the same column.   b. If the entire column is non-decreasing, increment the count.2. The minimum deletions is (total columns) - (count of non-decreasing columns).So the code can be written as:Initialize count = 0For each column index j:   for each row i from 0 to len(A)-1 -1:       if A[i][j] > A[i+1][j]:           mark column j as not sorted, break.   if the column is sorted, count +=1Return total columns - count.So that's the approach.Now, let's code this in Python.The function will take A as a list of strings. All strings are of the same length.First, get the number of columns, which is the length of any string in A. Let's say m = len(A[0]).Then for each j in 0..m-1:   for i in 0..len(A)-2:       if A[i][j] > A[i+1][j]:           this column is not sorted, break.   if the loop completes without breaking, count +=1.Finally, return m - count.Yes, that's correct.Let's test this with the examples.Example 1:A = [\\"cba\\",\\"daf\\",\\"ghi\\"]Each string is length 3. So m=3.Check each column:Column 0:\\"c\\" vs \\"d\\": c < d → okay.\\"d\\" vs \\"g\\": d < g → okay. So column 0 is sorted. Count is 1.Column 1:\\"b\\" vs \\"a\\": b > a → not sorted. So column 1 is not counted.Column 2:\\"a\\" vs \\"f\\": a < f → okay.\\"f\\" vs \\"i\\": okay. So column 2 is counted. Total count 2. 3-2=1. Correct.Another example: [\\"zyx\\",\\"wvu\\",\\"tsr\\"]Each column j:Check column 0:z, w, t → z > w → breaks. So not counted.Column 1: y, v, s → y > v → not counted.Column 2: x, u, r → x>u → not counted. So count 0. 3-0=3. Correct.Another example: [\\"a\\",\\"b\\"] → each string is length 1. So m=1. Check column 0: only one element, so it's trivially sorted. Count 1. 1-1=0. Correct.So the code works for these cases.Now, code in Python:The function is:def minDeletionSize(self, A: List[str]) -> int:    m = len(A[0]) if A else 0    count =0    for j in range(m):        sorted_col = True        for i in range(len(A)-1):            if A[i][j] > A[i+1][j]:                sorted_col = False                break        if sorted_col:            count +=1    return m - countYes, that should work.Let me check edge cases. For example, when A is empty, but according to constraints, A's length is >=1. So we can safely proceed.Another edge case: when all columns are non-decreasing. Then count = m → answer is 0.Another case: when a column has all characters equal. Like [\\"aaa\\",\\"aaa\\"], which is sorted.So this code should handle all cases.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of columns to delete from an array of strings such that each remaining column is in non-decreasing order.

The problem is to add all the digits of a number repeatedly until we get a single digit. Like, for 38, it's 3+8=11, then 1+1=2. So the output is 2. Hmm, the first thought is to do this step by step: take the number, sum its digits, check if it's a single digit. If not, repeat. But the follow-up asks for an O(1) solution without loops or recursion. Oh right, so there must be a mathematical formula here.Wait, what's the pattern here? Let's think about some examples. Let's see:For numbers from 0 to 9, the answer is the number itself.For 10, it's 1+0=1. 11 becomes 2, 12 becomes 3, up to 18 which is 9. Then 19 is 1+9=10, then 1. Wait, 19: 1+9=10, then 1+0=1. So the result is 1. Similarly, 20 would be 2. Hmm, maybe the result cycles every 9? Like, it's the remainder when divided by 9. But wait, what about 18? 1+8=9, so the remainder of 18 divided by 9 is 0. But the result is 9, not 0. So maybe there's a special case for numbers divisible by 9, except 0.So the formula could be: if the number is 0, return 0. Otherwise, if num %9 is 0, return 9, else return num%9. But wait, let's check some examples.Take 9: 9%9=0, so according to this, return 9. Correct.Take 18: same as above. Correct.Take 27: same. So that works. What about numbers that aren't multiples of 9. Like 38. 38 divided by 9 is 4*9=36, remainder 2. So according to formula, 2. Correct. So that seems to fit.But what about 0? The problem says non-negative integer. So 0 should return 0, which the formula handles.So the O(1) solution is to compute the digital root using this formula. The digital root is the single digit obtained by this process. And the formula for the digital root is as described.So the code would need to handle the case where num is 0. Otherwise, return num%9 if it's not zero, else 9.So putting this together into a function. Let's code it.Wait, but wait: how about the case when num is 0? The problem says num is non-negative. So if num is 0, return 0. Otherwise, check the remainder. So the code can be written as:if num == 0:    return 0else:    remainder = num % 9    return remainder if remainder !=0 else 9But perhaps this can be written in a one-liner using some mathematical expressions.Alternatively, another way: The formula for digital root is known to be 1 + (num -1) %9. Let's test this.For num=0: 1 + (-1) mod9 = 0. Wait, but (-1 mod9) is 8? So 1+8=9, which is wrong. So that formula works when num is not zero. But for num=0, it would give 9, which is incorrect. So in code, we need to handle 0 as a special case.So the code can be written as:if num ==0:    return 0else:    return 9 if num%9 ==0 else num%9Alternatively, using the formula: 1 + (num-1) %9, but then for num=0, that would be 1 + (-1) mod9. Let's see. (-1) mod9 in Python is 8, because in Python, the modulo operation returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So 9 is the divisor. So -1 %9 is 8. So 1+8=9. Which is wrong for num=0. So that's why we need to handle 0 as a separate case.So the code can be:def addDigits(num: int) -> int:    if num ==0:        return 0    return 9 if num %9 ==0 else num%9But wait, let's test some numbers.Test case 38: 38%9 is 2, since 9*4=36, 38-36=2. So returns 2. Correct.Test case 0: returns 0. Correct.Test case 9: returns 9. Correct.Test case 18: returns 9. Correct.Test case 19: 19%9 is 1 (since 9*2=18, 19-18=1). So returns 1. Which is correct (1+9=10, 1+0=1).Test case 10: 10%9=1. Correct.So this seems to handle all cases.So the function is as above. So the Python code would be:class Solution:    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:        if num == 0:            return 0        return 9 if num % 9 ==0 else num %9Alternatively, we can write it as:return 0 if num ==0 else 9 if num %9 ==0 else num%9But perhaps using the formula 1 + (num-1) %9 would work if we handle 0. Wait, let's see:For num=0: return 0.Otherwise, 1 + (num-1) %9.Let's see:For num=1: 1 + 0%9=1. Correct.num=9: 1 +8%9=9. Correct.num=10: 1 +9%9=1 +0=1. Correct.num=38: 1 +37%9. 37 divided by 9 is 4*9=36, remainder 1. 1+1=2. Correct.So the formula 1 + (num-1) %9 gives the correct answer for num >=1.So the code can be written as:return 0 if num ==0 else 1 + (num-1) %9Which is more concise.Let's test that:num=0: 0.num=9: 1 +8%9=9. Correct.num=10: 1+9%9=1+0=1. Correct.num=38:1+37%9=1+1=2. Correct.num=19:1+18%9=1+0=1. Correct.num=18:1+17%9=1+ (17-9*1=8) 8 → 1+8=9. Correct.So this formula works. So the code can be written as:def addDigits(num: int) -> int:    return 0 if num ==0 else 1 + (num -1) %9Which is even better.So why does this formula work? Because the digital root is known to follow this formula. The digital root is exactly this.So the code can be written as a one-liner handling 0 as a special case.So the final code is as above.But wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for (num-1) %9, since 9 is positive, the remainder will be in 0-8. So 1 + that gives 1-9, which is correct.Yes. So this code works.So the function in the Solution class would be:class Solution:    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:        return 0 if num == 0 else 1 + (num -1) % 9This handles all cases. For example, num=0 returns 0. num=1 returns 1. num=9 returns 9, etc. Correct.This is the O(1) solution without any loops or recursion.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly add all the digits of a non-negative integer until the result has only one digit.

The digital root of a number can be computed using a formula derived from number theory. The digital root of a number \`num\` is given by:- 0 if \`num\` is 0.- 1 + (num - 1) % 9 for any non-zero number.This formula works because the digital root of a number in base 10 is equivalent to its value modulo 9, with a special case for multiples of 9, which should return 9 instead of 0.

So, the order within even indices doesn't matter, nor the order within odd indices. But the even and odd characters are separate.Wait, right. So for a string S, if we separate the characters into two groups: those at even indices and those at odd indices. Then, for two strings to be special-equivalent, their even group characters (sorted) must match, and their odd group characters (sorted) must match. Because you can rearrange the even-indexed characters in any order and same with the odd ones.Wait, but the original problem says you can swap any two even-indexed characters any number of times, which allows you to permute the even characters. Similarly for odd. So the sorted even and sorted odd parts would form a unique key. So, for each string, if we split the characters into even and odd indices, sort each group, and then combine them (maybe concatenate the sorted even and sorted odd strings), then all strings in the same group will have the same key. Then the number of unique keys is the answer.Yes. So for example, the first example:Take \\"abcd\\". The even indices (0, 2) are 'a' and 'c', sorted becomes 'ac'. The odd indices (1,3) are 'b' and 'd', sorted 'bd'. So the key is 'acbd'.For \\"cdab\\", the even indices are c (index 0) and a (index 2), sorted as 'ac'; the odd indices are d and b, sorted as 'bd'. Same key. So they are in the same group.Similarly, \\"cbad\\": even indices 0 and 2 are c and a → sorted 'ac', odd indices 1 and 3 are b and d → sorted 'bd'. So same key.Thus, all three have the same key and form a group.For \\"xyzz\\": even indices are x (0) and z (2) → sorted xz, odd indices y (1) and z (3) → sorted yz. Key is xz + yz = xzyz. Wait, but \\"zzxy\\" has even indices z and x (indices 0 and 2) → sorted xz, same as before. Odd indices z (1) and y (3) → sorted yz. So same key. So both \\"xyzz\\" and \\"zzxy\\" have the same key. But \\"zzyx\\" has even indices z and z (0 and 2) → sorted zz. Odd indices z (1) and x (3) → sorted xz. So key is zz + xz, which is different. So they form different groups.So the example 1's groups are correct based on this key approach.So the plan is:1. For each string in A, split into even and odd indexed characters.2. Sort each group.3. Create a key by concatenating the sorted even and sorted odd strings.4. The number of unique keys is the answer.Therefore, the solution is to compute this key for each string, then count the number of distinct keys.So how to implement this in Python.Let's think about how to split the even and odd indices. The indices are 0-based. So for a string like \\"abcd\\", even indices are 0, 2 (if the length is even). Wait, for index i, even if i is even (i % 2 == 0). So for each character in the string, if its index is even, put it into the even group, else into the odd group.So for each string s:even_chars = sorted([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])odd_chars = sorted([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 1])Then, the key is a tuple of (tuple(even_chars), tuple(odd_chars)), or a string formed by concatenating the even and odd sorted lists.Using tuples as keys might be more efficient, but strings are easier to handle. For example, for even sorted string and odd sorted string, concatenated. So for even, we can take ''.join(even_chars), same for odd, then the key is even_str + odd_str. Or even include a separator if needed, but maybe not necessary. For example, if even is \\"ac\\" and odd is \\"bd\\", the key is \\"acbd\\". But if even is \\"a\\" and odd is \\"b\\", the key is \\"ab\\". But another string with even \\"a\\" and odd \\"b\\" would have the same key. So this works.So the steps for each string:- split into even and odd characters.- sort each group.- concatenate the two sorted groups as a string.Then, group all strings that produce the same key. The number of such unique keys is the answer.So in Python code:We can process each string in A, generate the key as described, add it to a set, then return the length of the set.Yes.Now, let's test this approach against the examples.Example 1:Input: [\\"abcd\\",\\"cdab\\",\\"cbad\\",\\"xyzz\\",\\"zzxy\\",\\"zzyx\\"]Processing \\"abcd\\":even indices 0, 2: 'a', 'c' → sorted \\"ac\\"odd indices 1,3: 'b','d' → sorted \\"bd\\"key = \\"acbd\\"\\"cdab\\": even indices 0: 'c', 2: 'a' → sorted \\"ac\\", odd indices 1: 'd', 3: 'b' → sorted \\"bd\\". Key \\"acbd\\".\\"cbad\\": even indices 0: 'c', 2: 'a' → \\"ac\\", odd indices 1: 'b', 3: 'd' → \\"bd\\". Same key.\\"xyzz\\": even indices 0: 'x', 2: 'z' → \\"xz\\"; odd indices 1: 'y', 3: 'z' → \\"yz\\". Key \\"xz\\"+\\"yz\\" = \\"xzyz\\".\\"zzxy\\": even indices 0: 'z', 2: 'x' → sorted \\"xz\\"; odd indices 1: 'z', 3: 'y' → sorted \\"yz\\". Same key as \\"xyzz\\".\\"zzyx\\": even indices 0: 'z', 2: 'z' → \\"zz\\"; odd indices 1: 'z', 3: 'x' → sorted \\"xz\\". Key \\"zzxz\\".So the unique keys are \\"acbd\\", \\"xzyz\\", \\"zzxz\\" → 3 groups. Which matches the example 1 output.Another example, example 2:Input: [\\"abc\\",\\"acb\\",\\"bac\\",\\"bca\\",\\"cab\\",\\"cba\\"]Each string is length 3.Processing \\"abc\\":even indices 0, 2: 'a' and 'c' → sorted \\"ac\\"odd index 1: 'b' → \\"b\\"key is \\"ac\\" + \\"b\\" → \\"acb\\".\\"acb\\": even indices 0: 'a', 2: 'b' → sorted \\"ab\\"; odd index 1: 'c' → \\"c\\". Key \\"abc\\".Wait, no. Let me recheck.Wait, \\"abc\\" is index 0: 'a' (even), 1: 'b' (odd), 2: 'c' (even). So even group is ['a','c'] sorted to 'ac'; odd group is ['b'] → key 'acb'.\\"acb\\": even indices 0: 'a', 2: 'b' → sorted 'ab'; odd index 1: 'c' → 'c'. Key is 'ab' + 'c' → 'abc'.So these two have different keys. Then, in the input array, how many unique keys?Wait, let's process all strings in example 2.\\"abc\\": even 'a','c' → 'ac', odd 'b' → 'b' → key 'acb'.\\"acb\\": even 'a','b' → 'ab', odd 'c' → 'c' → key 'ab c' → 'abc'.\\"bac\\": even indices 0: 'b', 2: 'c' → 'bc'; odd index 1: 'a' → 'a' → key 'bca'.\\"bca\\": even indices 0: 'b', 2: 'a' → sorted 'ab'; odd 1: 'c' → 'c' → key 'abc' same as \\"acb\\".\\"cab\\": even 0: 'c', 2: 'b' → sorted 'bc'; odd 1: 'a' → 'a' → key 'bca'.\\"cba\\": even 0: 'c', 2: 'a' → 'ac'; odd 1: 'b' → 'b' → key 'acb'.So the keys for the six strings are:\\"acb\\", \\"abc\\", \\"bca\\", \\"abc\\", \\"bca\\", \\"acb\\".So the unique keys are \\"acb\\", \\"abc\\", \\"bca\\" → 3 groups, which matches example 2's output of 3.So the approach works here.Thus, the solution is to compute the key for each string as described and count the unique keys.Now, coding this in Python.The function will be part of a class Solution, with a method numSpecialEquivGroups that takes a list of strings A and returns an integer.So steps:For each string in A:- split into even and odd characters.Even indices: 0, 2, 4, etc.Odd indices: 1, 3, 5, etc.We can collect the characters at even indices, sort them, then collect the characters at odd indices, sort them, and concatenate the two sorted lists into a string (or as a tuple, which can be used as a key in a set).In Python, to collect even indices:even = sorted(s[::2])  # since s starts from 0, step 2 gives 0,2,4...Wait, no. Wait, for example, s = \\"abcd\\", s[::2] is 'ac' (indices 0 and 2), which is correct.For s = 'abcde', s[::2] is 'ace' (indices 0,2,4), which is even indices.Similarly, for odd indices: s[1::2] gives characters at indices 1,3,5...Yes. So even_chars can be obtained by s[::2], sorted, and odd_chars by s[1::2], sorted.So for each string s:even = sorted(s[::2])odd = sorted(s[1::2])key = (tuple(even), tuple(odd))  # tuples are hashable, or we can join them into a string.Alternatively, we can create a string by joining the sorted even and sorted odd.For example:key = ''.join(even) + ''.join(odd)But what if even and odd have same characters but in different groups? Well, the concatenation is even followed by odd, so that's unique.So for the example 2, the keys would be:For \\"abc\\": even is ['a','c'] → 'ac', odd is ['b'] → 'b' → 'acb'.For \\"acb\\": even is ['a','b'] → 'ab', odd is ['c'] → 'ab' + 'c' = 'abc'.So using the joined strings as keys works.Thus, the code can be written as:def numSpecialEquivGroups(self, A: List[str]) -> int:    groups = set()    for s in A:        even = sorted(s[::2])        odd = sorted(s[1::2])        key = ''.join(even) + ''.join(odd)        groups.add(key)    return len(groups)Wait, let's test this with example 1.For \\"abcd\\":even is s[::2] → 'ac', sorted → 'ac' (already sorted). odd is s[1::2] → 'bd' → sorted 'bd'. key is 'acbd'.Which is correct. So the code will generate the key as expected.In example 1, the code will collect 3 unique keys, hence the output is 3.Yes.Another test case: example 2.Each string's key is as computed before, leading to 3 unique keys.Thus, this code should work.So this should be the correct solution. The function uses the sorted even and odd characters to form a key, and the number of unique keys is the number of groups.Thus, the code is straightforward.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from a given list. Two strings are considered special-equivalent if they can be transformed into each other by swapping any two even-indexed characters or any two odd-indexed characters any number of times. Approach1. Key Insight: For two strings to be special-equivalent, the characters at even indices in one string must be a permutation of the characters at even indices in the other string. Similarly, the characters at odd indices must also be a permutation of each other. Therefore, the problem reduces to grouping strings based on their sorted even-indexed and sorted odd-indexed characters.2. Key Generation: For each string, generate a key by sorting the characters at even indices and odd indices separately, then concatenating these sorted strings. This key uniquely identifies the group of special-equivalent strings.3. Count Unique Groups: Use a set to collect all unique keys, and the size of this set gives the number of groups.

The number of unique keys in the set corresponds to the number of special-equivalent groups.This approach efficiently groups strings by their special-equivalence properties using sorting and hashing, ensuring an optimal and straightforward solution."},{"problem":"Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.Find the letter that was added in t.Example:Input:s = \\"abcd\\"t = \\"abcde\\"Output:eExplanation:'e' is the letter that was added.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where given two strings s and t, t is formed by shuffling s and adding an extra letter. My task is to find that extra letter. Let's think about how to approach this.Hmm, the example given is s=\\"abcd\\" and t=\\"abcde\\", so the output is 'e'. So the added character is the one present in t but not in s, but since it's a shuffle, the counts of other characters are the same except for one. Wait, but maybe the added character is one that was already present in s but with a higher count. Like, if s has two 'a's and t has three, then the extra is 'a'.So the key is to compare the counts of each character in s and t. The one with a higher count in t is the answer. So how can I efficiently compute that?One way is to use a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to count the frequency of each character in s, then subtract the counts by checking each character in t. The one that ends up with a negative count (or the one that is found in t but not in s) would be the extra character.Alternatively, another approach could be using the XOR operation on all characters. Since XOR of two same numbers is zero, XORing all characters in s and then XORing with all in t would leave the extra character. Let me think: for example, if s is 'abc' and t is 'abcd', then XOR of a^b^c in s, then XOR with a^b^c^d in t. The result would be (a^a) ^ (b^b) ^ (c^c) ^d = 0^0^0^d = d. So that works. That's a clever approach and might be more efficient as it's O(n) time and O(1) space.But wait, what if the added character is a duplicate? Like s has 'a' once, t has 'a' twice. Then XOR approach would not work, right? Because XOR a twice would cancel out. Wait, no. Let's see: s has a, then t has a and another a. So XOR all characters in s: a. Then XOR all in t: a^a. The result is (a) XOR (a^a) = (a) XOR (0) = a. But the added character is a. So XOR gives a, which is correct. Wait, wait. Let's compute step by step.Suppose s is 'a' and t is 'aa'. So the XOR for s is a. For t, it's a XOR a = 0. Then XOR the two results: a XOR 0 = a. So the result is a, which is correct. So in this case, the XOR approach works even when the added character is a duplicate. Because when you XOR all the characters in s and then XOR all in t (including the extra), the result is the extra character, regardless of whether it's a new character or a duplicate.Wait, no. Let's think again. The XOR approach would work here because all the other characters except the added one are present in both s and t. Because t is s shuffled plus one character. So, for each character in s, t has that same character once, except for one which has an extra. Wait no: t has all of s's characters plus one more. So the total length of t is len(s)+1.Wait, the problem statement says t is generated by shuffling s and adding one more letter. So in t, all characters of s are present, plus exactly one more. So the XOR approach would work here. Because for all the characters in s, their counts in t would be one more than in s, except for the added character which is one more. Wait, no. Let's see. Suppose s has 'aab', so counts a:2, b:1. t is s shuffled plus another 'a'. So t has counts a:3, b:1. Then the XOR approach would XOR all characters in s: a ^ a ^ b = 0 ^ b = b. Then XOR all in t: a ^ a ^ a ^ b = (a^a)^ (a^b) = 0 ^ (a^b) = a^b. Then XOR s and t results: b ^ (a^b) = a. So the result is 'a', which is correct. So the XOR approach works here.So regardless of whether the added character is a new one or a duplicate, the XOR approach gives the correct result. So that's a possible solution.Another approach is using sum differences. For example, sum the Unicode values of all characters in t, subtract the sum of s, the difference is the Unicode value of the added character. Let's test this. For example, s= \\"abcd\\" sum is 97+98+99+100=394. t= \\"abcde\\" sum is 394 + 101 = 495. 495-394=101, which is 'e'. Correct. Another example, s=\\"aab\\" sum is 97*2 +98 = 292. t adds another 'a', sum is 97*3 +98= 389. 389-292=97, which is 'a'. Correct. So the sum approach would work here.But what about overflow? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. So sum approach is O(n) time and O(1) space as well. But which is better between sum and XOR? Both are linear. Sum may involve adding numbers which can be large, but in Python that's manageable. The sum approach seems straightforward.So for the solution, the steps are:1. Initialize a variable as 0.2. For each character in s, subtract its Unicode value from the variable.3. For each character in t, add its Unicode value to the variable.4. The resulting sum is the Unicode value of the added character. So convert it to a character.Alternatively, compute the sum of t's characters minus the sum of s's characters. The difference is the code of the added character.So code would be something like:sum_t = sum(ord(c) for c in t)sum_s = sum(ord(c) for c in s)return chr(sum_t - sum_s)But since t is longer than s by exactly one character, sum_t - sum_s will be the code of the added character.This approach is simple and efficient.Another way is using a dictionary. For each character in s, count the frequency. Then iterate through t and subtract counts. The one that becomes negative or not present is the answer.But for code, the sum approach is easier to implement and has O(n) time and O(1) space.What about cases where s is empty? For example, s is \\"\\" and t is \\"a\\". Then sum_t - sum_s is 97-0=97, which is correct.So the code for the function would be:def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:    return chr(sum(ord(c) for c in t) - sum(ord(c) for c in s))Yes, that's concise and correct.But let's test the XOR approach as well. Let's see.Initialize a variable xor_sum as 0.For each c in s:    xor_sum ^= ord(c)For each c in t:    xor_sum ^= ord(c)Then return chr(xor_sum)Because all the characters in s and t except the added one will cancel each other out. For example, in the first example, s is abcd, so ord(a)^b^c^d. Then t is abcde: when we XOR all, the a^a, b^b, c^c, d^d, and then e. So the result is e.Another example where the added character is a duplicate. Let's take s=\\"aa\\", t=\\"aaa\\". XOR for s is a^a=0. XOR for t is a^a^a = a. So 0 ^ (a^a^a) = a. So the result is 'a', which is correct.So the XOR approach works as well.Which approach is better? Both are O(n) time and O(1) space. The sum approach is straightforward. The XOR approach might be faster in some cases, but in Python, the sum is likely to be efficient.So either approach is acceptable. The code for XOR would be:def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:    xor_sum = 0    for c in s:        xor_sum ^= ord(c)    for c in t:        xor_sum ^= ord(c)    return chr(xor_sum)This should also work.Testing the first example: s is \\"abcd\\", t is \\"abcde\\".sum of s: 97+98+99+100=394.sum of t: 394+101=495. 495-394=101 → 'e'.XOR: ord(a) ^ ord(b) ^ ord(c) ^ ord(d) → let's compute:97 in binary is 0b110000198: 0b110001099: 0b1100011100: 0b1100100XOR all:Let's compute step by step:97 ^ 98 → 000011 (3) in decimal 3.3 ^ 99 (99 is 1100011):3 in binary is 0000011.XOR 1100011 → 1100000 (96)96 ^ 100 (1100100):96 is 1100000.1100000 ^ 1100100 = 0000100 → 4.So XOR after s is 4.Then XOR with each character in t: a, b, c, d, e.So XOR with a (97) again: 4 ^97.4 is 0000100, 97 is 1100001.XOR → 1100101 (101 in decimal, which is 'e').So then XOR with b (98): 101 ^98 = 0011011 (27).Then XOR with c (99): 27 ^99 = 120.Then XOR with d (100): 120 ^100 = 28.Then XOR with e (101): 28 ^101 = 121. Wait, but the correct answer is e (101). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Wait no. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the steps. Let's re-calculate the XOR approach for the example.Wait, maybe the correct way is to XOR all characters in s and then all in t, including the added one. So for the example:s is 'abcd' → a, b, c, d.t is 'abcde' → a, b, c, d, e.So XOR all s: a ^ b ^ c ^ d.Then XOR all t: a ^ b ^ c ^ d ^ e.But the code first XORs all s, then XORs all t. So the total XOR is (a ^ b ^ c ^ d) ^ (a ^ b ^ c ^ d ^ e) → which simplifies to e. Because a^a=0, etc. So the result is e.So the code works.Thus, both the sum and XOR approaches work.Which one is better in Python? Let's think about code efficiency. For sum, we iterate through both strings once each. For XOR, same. Both have O(n) time. The sum approach requires summing the ordinals, which are integers, but in Python, sum is a built-in function and may be optimized. The XOR approach uses a loop and bitwise operations. But in practice, both should be similar in performance.Another approach is using collections.Counter. Let's see:We can count the frequency of each character in s, then subtract in t. The one with a difference of 1 is the answer.For example:from collections import Counterdef findTheDifference(s, t):    count = Counter(t)    count.subtract(s)    for c, v in count.items():        if v == 1:            return cBut this may have some edge cases. For example, if s is empty, then count is Counter(t), which has one character with count 1. So that works.But using Counter might involve more overhead than the sum or XOR approach, especially for very long strings. But for the problem constraints, it's acceptable. However, the code is a bit longer, and requires importing Counter.In the problem statement, the code is supposed to be part of a class Solution. So, considering code length and efficiency, the sum approach is the simplest and most efficient.So the final code would be using the sum difference.Therefore, the Python function would be:class Solution:    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:        return chr(sum(ord(c) for c in t) - sum(ord(c) for c in s))This code is concise and handles all cases correctly.Another test case: s is empty, t is 'x'. Then sum of s is 0, sum of t is 120. 120-0=120 → 'x'. Correct.Another test case: s = 'a', t = 'aa'. Sum of s is 97, sum of t is 194. 194-97=97 → 'a'. Correct.Another case where t adds a new character: s='xyz', t='xya z' (but that's a space, which isn't allowed as per the problem statement). Wait, problem says only lowercase letters. So the added character is another lowercase. So sum approach works.So this solution should be correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the additional character that is present in string \`t\` but not in string \`s\`, given that \`t\` is formed by shuffling \`s\` and adding exactly one extra character at a random position.

Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place. The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.Example 1:Input: \\"UD\\"Output: trueExample 2:Input: \\"LL\\"Output: false","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if a robot returns to the original position after a series of moves. The moves are given as a string, with each character being U, D, L, or R. So I need to find out if the robot ends up at (0,0) after all the moves.Hmm. The initial position is (0,0). Each move changes the coordinates. For example, U increases the y-coordinate by 1, D decreases it by 1. Similarly, R increases x by 1, L decreases x by 1. So the idea is to track the x and y values as we process each move.So the approach would be: iterate through each move in the string, update x and y accordingly. After processing all moves, check if both x and y are zero. If yes, return true; else, false.Let me think about possible test cases. For example, the first sample input \\"UD\\" would result in y moving up then down, ending at 0. x remains 0. So returns true. The second example \\"LL\\" would move left twice, so x is -2, which is not 0, so false.What about other cases? Like \\"UDLR\\"? Let's see. U: y+1, D: y-1, L: x-1, R: x+1. So total x is 0, y is 0. Returns true. So that's correct.Now, how to implement this in Python. The function is called judgeCircle, which takes a string moves and returns a boolean.So initialize x and y to 0. Then loop through each character in moves. For each move, adjust x and y:- 'U' → y += 1- 'D' → y -= 1- 'L' → x -= 1- 'R' → x += 1Then, after all moves, check if x == 0 and y == 0.That seems straightforward. Let's code that.Wait, what about empty string? If moves is empty, the robot hasn't moved, so returns true. Because (0,0) is the starting and ending position.But according to the problem statement, the input is a sequence of moves. So the empty string is possible, and the answer should be true.So code:def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:    x = y = 0    for move in moves:        if move == 'U':            y += 1        elif move == 'D':            y -= 1        elif move == 'L':            x -= 1        elif move == 'R':            x += 1    return x == 0 and y == 0That's the code. Let me test it against the examples.Example 1: \\"UD\\" → U: y becomes 1, D: y back to 0. x remains 0. So returns True. Correct.Example 2: \\"LL\\" → x decreases by 2, so x is -2. y is 0. So returns False. Correct.Another test case: \\"ULDR\\" → U (y=1), L (x=-1), D (y=0), R (x=0). So returns True.What about a longer string? Like \\"UUDDLRLR\\" → Let's compute:U: y=1U: y=2D: y=1D: y=0L: x=-1R: x=0L: x=-1R: x=0So final x is 0, y is 0. So returns True. Wait, but the moves after that would be:Original moves: UUDDLRLR. Let's list each step:Start at (0,0).1. U → (0,1)2. U → (0,2)3. D → (0,1)4. D → (0,0)5. L → (-1,0)6. R → (0,0)7. L → (-1,0)8. R → (0,0). Wait, no. Let's see:Wait step 5 is L: x becomes -1. Step 6: R → x back to 0. Step7: L → x -1 again. Step8: R → x 0. So final x is 0, y is 0. So returns True. Correct.So the code seems to handle that.Now, what about efficiency? Since each move is processed in O(1) time, the overall time is O(n), which is acceptable for any input size.Another approach could be to count the number of each move. For example, the number of U's must equal D's, and the number of L's must equal R's. Because that way, the net movement in vertical and horizontal directions is zero.So for example, if count['U'] == count['D'], then the net y is zero. Similarly for L and R. So this is another way to compute.Which method is better? The first method is straightforward and processes each character once, same as the second. The second approach would require counting each move type, but for Python, perhaps using a Counter or a dictionary. For example, counts = {'U':0, 'D':0, 'L':0, 'R':0}, then for each move, increment the count. Then check if U == D and L == R.This could be done with:from collections import Countercounts = Counter(moves)return counts.get('U',0) == counts.get('D',0) and counts.get('L',0) == counts.get('R',0)But using Counter would count all the moves in one pass, which is O(n) time. But accessing the counts is O(1). So this approach might be more efficient, but in practice, both methods have the same time complexity.Which one is better? Well, the code using the Counter is more concise, but maybe for very large strings, the per-character approach could be slightly faster, but in practice, the difference is negligible.But the per-character approach is straightforward and requires no imports. Let's see. For the first approach, code is simple. The second approach:def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:    return moves.count('U') == moves.count('D') and moves.count('L') == moves.count('R')Wait, that's even simpler! Because the count method can be used directly. For example, the number of U's in moves is moves.count('U'), same for D, L, R.So for example, \\"UD\\" → U count 1, D count 1 → equal. L count 0, R count 0 → equal. So returns True.Another example, \\"LL\\" → L count 2. R count 0. So 2 != 0 → returns False.This approach is even more efficient, perhaps. Because instead of looping through each character, the count method is O(n) but optimized in Python. So for each of the four counts, it's O(n) each, but in practice, the total is O(n) because each count traverses the string once. Wait, no. Each count is O(n) and we do four counts, so total O(4n) → O(n). But the per-character approach is O(n) as well. So for n being the length of moves, both methods are O(n). But the code using count is much shorter and perhaps more efficient in practice.But what about the case where the moves are very long? For example, a string of length 1e6. Then the per-character approach would process each character once, whereas the count approach would process the string four times, each time counting a different character. So in that case, the per-character approach would be faster. Because 4 passes over a very long string is 4 times slower than a single pass.Wait, but in the per-character approach, you have to loop through each character once, and for each character, perform a few condition checks. So for each character, 1-4 checks (depending on the order of the if-elif chain). So for a 1e6 character string, it's O(n) time. The count approach would loop through the string four times, each time counting a different character. So for four passes, O(4n) time.But perhaps the count method is optimized in C, so even with four passes, it could be faster than the Python loop with conditionals. So it's possible that the count approach is faster in practice, despite the four passes.But in code, the count approach is much shorter. So which one to choose?The problem says to generate an executable Python function. So using the count approach would be more efficient and concise.So the code can be written as:return moves.count('U') == moves.count('D') and moves.count('L') == moves.count('R')This is much simpler. Let's test this with the examples.Example 1: \\"UD\\" → U count 1, D count 1. L and R counts 0. So returns True.Example 2: \\"LL\\" → L count 2. R count 0. So 2 != 0 → returns False.Another test case: \\"ULDR\\" → U:1, D:1 → equal. L:1, R:1 → equal. So returns True.Another case: \\"UUUDD\\" → U:3, D:2. Not equal → returns False.So this approach works.Therefore, the optimal code is to use the count method. So the function can be written as:class Solution:    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:        return moves.count('U') == moves.count('D') and moves.count('L') == moves.count('R')This is concise and efficient.But wait, what about other characters? The problem says the moves are only U, D, L, R. So we don't have to handle other characters. So the code is correct.Thus, this approach is better. So the code is much shorter and efficient.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a robot returns to its starting position (0, 0) after following a sequence of moves given as a string. Each move can be 'U' (Up), 'D' (Down), 'L' (Left), or 'R' (Right). ApproachThe key insight here is that for the robot to return to the starting position, the number of moves in the upward direction must equal the number of moves in the downward direction, and similarly, the number of moves to the left must equal the number of moves to the right.

The problem is about moving chips to the same position with minimum cost. Hmm, I remember that moving two steps costs nothing, but moving one step costs 1. So the cost depends on the parity of the positions. Because moving two steps is free, right? So maybe the key is to count how many chips are in even positions and how many are in odd positions.Wait, like, if all the chips are on even positions, then we can move them all to a single even position for free. Similarly for odd. But if there's a mix of even and odd, then we have to move some from even to odd or vice versa. But moving between parity (even to odd) requires a cost of 1 per chip. Because moving one step costs 1. So the minimal cost would be the smaller of the two counts (even count or odd count). Because you can choose to move all even to the odd position (cost is the number of even chips) or move all odd to even (cost is the number of odd chips). Whichever is smaller gives the minimal total cost.Wait, let me think through an example. Like example 1: positions [1,2,3]. The even positions are 2 (only one chip). The odd positions are 1 and 3 (two chips). So the minimal cost is min(1, 2) = 1. Which matches the example. And example 2: positions [2,2,2,3,3]. The even chips are three (positions 2), the odd are two (positions 3). So min(3, 2) is 2, which matches the output. And the third example: [1, 1e9]. Both are odd? Wait, 1 is odd, 1e9 is even. So even count is 1, odd count is 1. The minimal cost is 1. Which matches the example.So the solution seems to be to count the number of even and odd positions and take the minimum of those two counts.So the steps for the algorithm would be:1. Iterate through each position in the input list.2. For each position, check if it's even or odd.3. Increment the even count or odd count accordingly.4. Return the minimum of the two counts.That's it. Because moving all even to odd (cost even_count) or vice versa (cost odd_count), whichever is smaller.So how to code this in Python?The function is called minCostToMoveChips, takes a list of integers called position.Initialize even and odd counts to zero. Loop through each pos in position. For each pos, if pos % 2 == 0, increment even, else increment odd. Then return the minimum of even and odd.Yes. That seems straightforward. Let me test this logic against the examples.Example 1: positions [1,2,3]. Even is 1 (2), odd is 2 (1 and 3). Min is 1. Correct.Example 2: [2,2,2,3,3]. Even count 3, odd count 2. Min is 2. Correct.Example 3: [1,1e9]. 1 is odd, 1e9 is even. So even count 1, odd count 1. Min is 1. Correct.So the code should work. Then, the Python function would be:def minCostToMoveChips(self, position: List[int]) -> int:    even = 0    odd = 0    for pos in position:        if pos % 2 == 0:            even +=1        else:            odd +=1    return min(even, odd)Yes, that's the code.

Count Parity: Iterate through each chip position and count how many chips are in even positions and how many are in odd positions.2.

The problem is to group 2n integers into n pairs such that the sum of the minimum of each pair is as large as possible. Hmm. So the goal is to maximize the sum of the minimums. Wait, how do I approach this? Let's think about the example given. The input is [1,4,3,2], sorted becomes [1,2,3,4]. Then the pairs are (1,2) and (3,4), sum of min is 1 +3 =4. Oh right. So when sorted, pairing consecutive elements, and taking the first of each pair. Because if you pair the smallest with the next smallest, then the next two, etc., each min is the first in the pair. That way, you get all the even-indexed elements (after sorting) contributing to the sum.So maybe the optimal strategy is to sort the array and then take every second element starting from index 0. Because if you pair the first and second, third and fourth, etc., the min of each pair is the first element. Then adding those gives the maximum possible sum.Wait, why does that work? Let's think about other possibilities. Suppose I have [a, b, c, d] sorted in increasing order. If I pair a with b, c with d, then sum is a + c. If I pair a with c and b with d, then the sum is a + b, which is worse. Because a is the smallest, so pairing it with anything would make it the min. But if I pair the two largest numbers together, their min is the smaller of them. So maybe by grouping consecutive numbers, we can ensure that the larger numbers are not 'wasted' as mins. Wait, but when you pair two large numbers, their min is the smaller of the two. So if you have numbers like 3 and4, pairing them gives min 3. But if you pair 3 with a smaller number, say 2, then min is 2, and 4 is paired with someone else, min is their partner. So this approach would result in lower sum. So to maximize the sum of the mins, the best way is to have the second largest number be a min. Like, pairing the largest with the second largest. Then their min is the second largest. Then the next pair is third and fourth, min is third. So that way, the sum is sum of 2nd, 4th, etc. Wait, wait. Let me think again.Wait, for example: sorted array is a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., a2n. If we pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, etc., the sum is a1 +a3 +a5 + ... +a_{2n-1}. But if we pair a2 with a3, a4 with a5, etc., and a1 with a2n, then the sum would be a1 +a2 +a4 + ...? Hmm, maybe not. Let's see. Let's take a concrete example.Suppose the array is [1,2,3,4]. According to the first approach, pairs are (1,2), (3,4) sum is 1+3=4. Alternatively, if we pair (1,4), (2,3), the sum is 1+2=3. Which is worse. So the first approach gives a better sum.Another example: [1,3,5,7]. The first approach gives pairs (1,3), (5,7), sum 1+5=6. But if we pair (1,5), (3,7), sum is 1+3=4. So definitely the first approach is better.So it seems that the optimal way is to sort the array and then pair consecutive elements, taking the first element of each pair. Because that way, each pair contributes the smallest possible of the two, but in a way that allows the next higher numbers to contribute as well. So the sum of the even indices (0th, 2nd, 4th etc.) in the sorted array.Wait, sorted array is in ascending order, right? So after sorting, we take the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2. So sum those.So the approach is: sort the array, then sum every other element starting from index 0.So the steps are:1. Sort the array in ascending order.2. Iterate through the sorted array, adding every element at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) to the sum.Wait, but in the example given, after sorting [1,2,3,4], the elements at 0 and 2 are 1 and 3, sum is 4. Which matches the example. So that works.Another example: what if the array has 6 elements? Let's say [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Sorted, then pairs (1,2), (3,4), (5,6). Sum is 1+3+5=9. Alternatively, if we pair (1,6), (2,5), (3,4). Then the mins are 1, 2, 3. Sum is 6. Which is less than 9. So the first approach is better.So the conclusion is that the optimal sum is the sum of the elements at even indices (0-based) in the sorted array.So the algorithm is:- Sort the array.- Sum the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2.So how to implement this?In Python, we can sort the list, then take a slice of elements starting at 0, stepping by 2, and sum them.Wait, for example:sorted_nums = sorted(nums)sum = sum(sorted_nums[::2])Yes. Because for the example [1,2,3,4], sorted_nums[::2] is [1,3], sum 4.Another example: [6,5,4,3,2,1], when sorted becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The sum of elements at 0,2,4 is 1+3+5=9.So the code would be straightforward: sort the list and sum every other element starting from 0.So the function can be written as:def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:    nums.sort()    return sum(nums[::2])Wait, but what about when there are negative numbers? For example, let's say the array is [ -5, -4, -3, -2 ]. Sorted, it's [-5,-4,-3,-2]. The sum would be -5 + (-3) = -8. But if you pair (-5,-3) and (-4,-2), the mins would be -5 + (-4) = -9, which is worse. So the approach still works.So the key insight is that the optimal way is to pair the numbers in such a way that the sum of the minimums is maximized. By sorting and taking the even indices, we ensure that each pair includes the next smallest available number, allowing the higher numbers to contribute as the next pairs' minimums.

Let's think through this step by step.First, the problem says the flowerbed is an array of 0s and 1s. 0 means empty, 1 means planted. The rule is that you can't plant in adjacent plots. So when adding new flowers, each new flower must be placed in a spot that's 0, and the previous and next spots must also be 0 (or non-existent, like at the edges).The task is to check if we can plant n flowers given these constraints.Let me look at the examples. Example 1: [1,0,0,0,1], n=1. The output is True. So here, the middle position (index 2) is a valid spot because the adjacent are 0 and 0. Wait, but the original array is already valid. The problem note says the input array doesn't violate the rule. So we don't have to check that.So how do I approach this? I need to iterate through the flowerbed and find all possible positions where a flower can be planted, then count them and see if it's at least n.But how to efficiently check each position? Let's see.For each position i in the flowerbed:- If flowerbed[i] is already 1, skip.- Else, check if the previous position (i-1) and next position (i+1) are 0. Also, if i is at the start or end, then only check the adjacent one.Wait, but when you place a flower in i, you have to make sure that the previous and next are 0. But also, once you place it, you can't place in adjacent positions. But since we're trying to maximize the number of possible flowers, maybe we can greedily place flowers whenever possible. Because each time you place a flower, you block the adjacent spots, but to maximize the count, you need to place as soon as possible.So the algorithm should be something like:Initialize count = 0Iterate through each position in the flowerbed:    if current is 0, and previous is 0 (or i is 0), and next is 0 (or i is last index):        place a flower here (set to 1 in a copy array?), increment count        skip the next position since it's now blockedBut wait, modifying the original array might not be allowed. Wait, but in the problem, the input array is given, and we are to determine if it's possible, but perhaps the actual planting would require modifying it, but for the purpose of counting, we can simulate the placements.Wait, but the problem statement says: return True if n new flowers can be planted. So we can model this by checking possible spots, considering that placing a flower in a spot affects the adjacent positions.But how to simulate this without modifying the original array? Because the original array is given, but the new flowers would be added. So the original array's 1s are existing flowers, and we can't plant adjacent to them.Wait, the existing flowers already block adjacent positions. So when checking if a new flower can be placed at position i, we need to ensure that the current position is 0, and the previous and next positions are 0 (but considering existing 1s).So the steps would be:Loop through each position i from 0 to len(flowerbed)-1:    if flowerbed[i] is 0:        check if left (i-1) is 0 or i is 0        check if right (i+1) is 0 or i is len-1        if both are true, then this spot can be used. So we increment count, and mark this position as planted. But since we are only checking, not modifying the array, how do we account for the fact that planting here affects the next positions?Ah, right. Because if we plant here, the next position (i+1) can't be planted. So we need to process the array in such a way that after planting at i, we skip i+1.So the approach is to iterate through the array, and whenever we find a valid spot (current is 0, left and right are 0), we plant a flower there (count +=1) and skip the next position since it's now invalid.But how to implement this? Let's think.Initialize count = 0i = 0length = len(flowerbed)while i < length:    if flowerbed[i] == 0:        # check previous and next        prev_ok = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i-1] == 0)        next_ok = (i == length -1) or (flowerbed[i+1] == 0)        if prev_ok and next_ok:            count +=1            # plant here. So the next position (i+1) can't be planted, so we skip it            i +=2        else:            i +=1    else:        i +=1Wait, but in this approach, if we plant at i, we have to make sure that i+1 is skipped. But in the code, when we find a valid spot, we increment i by 2. Otherwise, increment by 1.But is this approach correct? Let's test it against the examples.Example 1: [1,0,0,0,1], n=1.The code starts at i=0, flowerbed[0] is 1, so move to i=1.At i=1: flowerbed[i] is 0. Check previous (i-1 is 0, which is 1, so prev_ok is False. So move to i=2.At i=2: flowerbed[i] is 0. prev is 0 (i=1 is 0), next is 0 (i=3 is 0). So prev_ok and next_ok are true. count becomes 1. Then i is incremented by 2 to 4.At i=4: flowerbed[i] is 1, move to i=5. Loop ends.count is 1, which is >=n (1). So returns True. Correct.Example 2: same flowerbed, n=2. The code would return count=1, so False. Correct.Another test case: [0,0,0]. How many can be planted?If we use the code:i=0: flowerbed[0] is 0. prev is i==0 → yes. next is i+1=0 (since i=0, next is 1 (0). So next_ok is (i+1 is 1, which is 0). So prev_ok and next_ok. So count=1. i increments by 2 to 2.i=2: flowerbed[2] is 0. prev is i-1=1, which is 0. But wait, after planting at 0, we skipped 1. So in the code, the array is not modified. So flowerbed[1] is still 0, but according to the algorithm, when we plant at 0, we skip 1, but here we are at i=2. Check prev (i-1=1) which is 0, next is i+1=3 (out of bounds). So next_ok is True. So can plant here. So count becomes 2. Then i increments by 2 to 4, loop ends. So the count is 2 for [0,0,0], which is correct. Because planting at 0 and 2. But wait, the original array is [0,0,0]. So if we plant at 0, then 1 is blocked. Then planting at 2 is allowed. So yes, two flowers can be placed. So the code would return count=2. So for n=2, returns True.But wait, the array is [0,0,0]. The correct maximum is 1. Wait, no. Wait, let's see. The original array is [0,0,0]. So existing array is allowed (since the problem says the input is valid). So how can we plant 2 flowers?Wait, no. Because if you plant at position 0, then position 1 cannot be planted. Then position 2 can be planted? Wait, planting at 0, then position 1 is blocked. So position 2 can be planted only if the previous (position 1) is 0. But after planting at 0, position 1 is blocked. So in that case, position 2's previous is 1 (but in the original array, it's 0). Wait, the algorithm is considering the original array, not the modified one. So that's the problem.Ah, here's the issue. The code above doesn't account for the flowers that are planted during the iteration. Because the code is not modifying the flowerbed array, when we plant a flower at i=0, in the code's logic, the next positions would still check the original array, which doesn't have the new flowers. So in the example [0,0,0], the code would plant at i=0, then skip to i=2. At i=2, it checks if current is 0 (yes). prev is i-1=1, which is 0. next is i+1=3 (out of bounds). So prev_ok is flowerbed[i-1] == 0. But in reality, if we planted at i=0, then i=1 is blocked. But in the code's check, since the original array's i=1 is 0, the code thinks that planting at i=2 is allowed. But in reality, after planting at i=0, the i=1 is now blocked. So planting at i=2 would require that i+1 is 0, but in reality, i-1 (i=1) is allowed? Wait no. Because after planting at 0, the code's approach is to simulate that by moving i to 2. So the code's logic assumes that planting at 0 blocks position 1, so when we move to i=2, the code can check if that position is allowed, considering that the original array's i=1 is 0, but in reality, we've already planted a flower at 0. So this is incorrect.So this approach is flawed. Because the code is not considering the flowers that were planted in previous steps. So in this case, the code would incorrectly allow planting at i=2, which would violate the adjacent rule because the flower at i=0 and i=2 are separated by one position (i=1), which is allowed. Wait, no. Because the code's approach is that when you plant at i=0, you skip i=1. Then, when you get to i=2, you check if the previous (i-1 =1) is 0, which it is. So according to the code, it's allowed, but in reality, since we planted at i=0, the next position is i=2. But the actual adjacency between 0 and 2 is two positions apart, which is allowed. So planting at 0 and 2 is allowed. So in the case of [0,0,0], the maximum is 2? Or is it 1?Wait, the array [0,0,0] can have flowers planted at positions 0 and 2. So the code's approach would count 2, which is correct. Because after planting at 0, you can't plant at 1, but planting at 2 is allowed. So the code's approach is correct here. So the code's logic is correct.Wait, let's think again. Original array: [0,0,0]. If you plant at i=0, then i=1 can't be planted. Then when i=2 is considered, since the original array's i=1 is 0, but we already planted at i=0. So the code's logic of checking the original array's i-1 is 0, which is true. So the code allows planting at i=2, but in reality, the previous flower is at i=0. But i-1 for i=2 is 1, which is 0. So the code allows planting here, which is correct because the flowers at 0 and 2 are not adjacent. So the code's approach is correct.So the code is correct because even though the code doesn't modify the array, the logic of checking adjacent positions in the original array and then skipping the next position after planting is sufficient.Wait, but in the code's logic, when you plant at i, you skip i+1. So in the [0,0,0] example, after planting at i=0, the code skips to i=2, then plants there. So count is 2, which is correct.Another test case: [0]. n=1. The code would check i=0. prev_ok (since i=0) and next_ok (since i is last index). So count is 1. Correct.Another test case: [0,0]. The code checks i=0. prev_ok (yes), next_ok (i+1 is 0. So if i=0 is the first position, then next is 1. So next_ok is flowerbed[i+1] ==0. So yes. So plant here, count +=1. Then i increments by 2 to 2. So for [0,0], the code counts 1, which is correct. Because you can plant in position 0, which blocks 1, so only one flower.Another example: [0,0,0,0,0]. The code would check i=0: can plant. count becomes 1, i becomes 2. At i=2: check if current is 0 (yes). prev is 1, which is 0. next is 3, which is 0. So plant here. count becomes 2, i becomes4. At i=4: check if current is 0. prev is 3, which is 0. next is out of bounds. So plant. count becomes 3. So total 3. Which is correct: positions 0, 2, 4 can be planted.So the code seems to handle these cases correctly.So the algorithm works by greedily planting flowers whenever possible, and then skipping the next position. Because the problem allows us to plant as many as possible, and we can check the maximum possible by this approach. Since the input array is already valid, the existing 1s are non-adjacent. So when we encounter a 0, checking its left and right (in the original array) is sufficient.So the code would proceed as:Initialize count to 0.Loop through each index i:If the current spot is 0.Check if the previous is 0 (or i is 0), and next is 0 (or i is last index).If both are true, then we can plant here. Increment count. Then skip the next spot (i +=2), since planting here blocks i+1.Otherwise, move to next i.If current spot is 1, move to next i (since existing flower, so next i is i+1, but the existing array is already valid, so after a 1, the next is 0 (if there is any), and then we can check the next possible spot.So the code's logic is correct.Thus, the code should be implemented as follows:In Python:class Solution:    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:        count = 0        i = 0        length = len(flowerbed)        while i < length:            if flowerbed[i] == 0:                # Check previous and next                prev_ok = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i-1] == 0)                next_ok = (i == length-1) or (flowerbed[i+1] == 0)                if prev_ok and next_ok:                    count +=1                    i +=2  # skip next spot                else:                    i +=1            else:                i +=1            # Early exit if possible            if count >=n:                return True        return count >=nWait, but what if n is 0? Then we can return True. But in code, if count (0) is >=n (0), returns True.Yes. So that's handled.Testing the code:Another test case: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1], n=2. Let's see.The possible spots are between the 1s.Original array: [1,0,0,0,0,0,1]We can plant in positions 2 and 4.The code would process i=0 (1) → skip.i=1: 0. prev is 1 (0's i-1 is 0, which is 1 → prev_ok is False. So move to i=2.i=2: 0. Check prev (i=1 is 0) and next (i=3 is 0). So yes. count becomes 1, i becomes4.i=4: 0. Check prev (i=3 is 0) and next (i=5 is 0). So yes. count becomes 2. i becomes6.i=6: 1. move to 7. loop ends. So count is 2, which is >=n=2 → True.Yes.Another case: flowerbed = [0,0,1,0,0], n=2. Let's see.Original array: [0,0,1,0,0]Possible spots: position 0 (can plant?), but after planting at 0, position 1 is blocked.Let's see code steps:i starts at 0.flowerbed[0] is 0.prev_ok (i=0 → yes), next_ok (i+1 is 0. So next_ok is (flowerbed[1] == 0 → yes). So plant here. count=1. i becomes2.i=2: flowerbed[2] is 1 → skip.i=3: 0. prev is flowerbed[2] (1 → prev_ok is False). move to i=4.i=4: 0. prev is flowerbed[3] (0). next is out of bounds. So prev_ok (0's value is 0) and next_ok (yes). So plant here. count=2. i becomes6. loop ends.So returns True. Correct, as planting at 0 and 4 is allowed.Thus, the code seems correct.So the final function should be as written.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can plant \`n\` new flowers in a given flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Otherwise, it returns False. Let's think about how to approach this.First, I should count how many times each element appears in the array. The easiest way to do this in Python is to use a dictionary. Maybe I can use the collections.Counter class for this. So, Counter(arr) would give me a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their counts.Once I have the counts, I need to check if all these counts are unique. That means there are no two different elements that have the same count. How can I check that? Well, if I take all the values from the counts and put them into a set, the size of the set should be the same as the number of keys in the counts. Because sets automatically remove duplicates. If there were duplicate counts, the set would have fewer elements than the original list of counts.So the steps are:1. Use Counter to get the frequency of each element in arr.2. Extract the values (the counts) from the Counter.3. Convert those counts into a set.4. Compare the length of the counts list and the set. If they are the same, return True; else, False.Wait, but what if there's an element that appears zero times? Well, according to the problem statement, the array elements are the ones present, so counts can't be zero. So no problem there.Let me test this logic against the examples.Example 1: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]Counter would be {1:3, 2:2, 3:1}. The counts are [3,2,1]. Convert to a set, size 3. So yes, same as length of counts list. So output is True. Which matches the example.Example 2: arr = [1,2]Counter is {1:1, 2:1}. Counts are [1,1]. The set would be {1}, length 1. Original counts list length is 2. So 1 != 2, returns False. Correct.Example 3: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]Counter: Let's see. Let's count each:-3 appears 3 times (positions 0,3,7)0 appears 2 times (positions 1 and 9)1 appears 4 times (positions 2,4,5,6)10 appears once.So counts are 3,2,4,1. All unique. So set size 4, same as list length 4. Returns True. Which matches the example.So this approach should work.Now, how to implement this in Python?The function will be part of a Solution class, taking arr as a parameter. We need to import List from typing for type hints.So, steps in code:Import Counter from collections.In the function:1. Get the counts using Counter(arr).2. Extract the values (counts.values()).3. Create a set from these values.4. Return len(counts.values()) == len(set_of_counts).Wait, but counts.values() returns a view object. So when we get the values, converting to a list might not be necessary. However, for the len, it's okay. But when converting to a set, the view is iterable, so the set can be created directly.So code:from collections import Counterclass Solution:    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:        counts = Counter(arr)        count_values = counts.values()        unique_counts = set(count_values)        return len(count_values) == len(unique_counts)Wait, but wait. What if the counts.values() has duplicates? Like in example 2. Then the set's length is smaller than the number of elements. So returning True only if they are equal.Yes, that's exactly the condition.Testing this code against the examples should work.But let's think about edge cases.Edge case 1: arr has one element. Then counts has one value (1), so set size is 1. So returns True.Edge case 2: all elements are same. So counts is {element: len(arr)}, and counts.values() has one element. So returns True.Another edge case: two different elements with same counts. Like [1,1,2,2]. Then counts are 2 and 2. So set size is 1. So returns False.What about if the counts have multiple duplicates but some unique? Like [1,1,2,2,3,3,3]. Counts are 2,2,3. The set is {2,3}, length 2. Original counts list length is 3. So returns False. Correct.So the code seems to handle all cases.But wait, in Python, the values() method returns a view. So, for example, if we have counts = Counter([1,2,2,1,1,3]), then counts.values() is a view of [3,2,1], right? So when we convert that to a set, the set will have 3 elements. len(counts.values()) is 3, len(unique_counts) is 3. So returns True.Yes.Another thing to consider: the counts can be zero? But in the problem, since the array is given, the counts are for elements present in the array, so each element's count is at least 1. So no zero counts.So the code should work.Therefore, the function is as written.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if the number of occurrences of each value in a given array is unique.

Hmm, let's think about what that means. So, x has to be a common divisor, meaning that both str1 and str2 can be formed by repeating x multiple times. Wait, right. So for example, if str1 is \\"ABCABC\\" and str2 is \\"ABC\\", then x is \\"ABC\\" because str1 is ABC repeated twice and str2 is ABC once. But in another case like str1 is \\"ABABAB\\" and str2 is \\"ABAB\\", then the answer is \\"AB\\" because ABAB is AB repeated 2 times, and ABABAB is AB repeated 3 times. So the key here is finding the greatest common divisor in terms of the repeating units.So how do I approach this? Maybe this problem is similar to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Because the length of x must be the GCD of the lengths of the two strings. Oh right! Because if the maximum possible divisor for both lengths is the GCD, then the length of x has to be the GCD of the lengths of str1 and str2. But then we also need to check if such a string of that length actually divides both strings.Wait, so the steps might be:1. Check if the two strings have a common prefix. Because if the concatenation of str1 + str2 is not equal to str2 + str1, then there's no common divisor. Because, for example, in example 3, LEET and CODE, combining them in either order gives different results. So in that case, there's no possible x. So first, check if str1 + str2 equals str2 + str1. If not, return empty string.If they do equal, then proceed to find the GCD of their lengths. Then, take the substring of the first string up to that GCD length, and that's the answer.Wait, let me think. For example, in example 2, str1 is length 6 (ABABAB), str2 is length 4 (ABAB). The GCD of 6 and 4 is 2. So the candidate x is length 2. So check if the first 2 characters of str1 (AB) can divide both. ABABAB is AB repeated 3 times, ABAB is AB repeated 2 times. So that works. So the candidate is the substring of length GCD(len1, len2), but only if this substring can divide both strings.But wait, maybe the step where you check the concatenation is sufficient. Because if str1 + str2 == str2 + str1, then there exists a common divisor. So the GCD of the lengths is the length of the maximum possible x, and the x is the substring up to that GCD.So the algorithm could be:- Check if str1 + str2 == str2 + str1. If not, return \\"\\".- Else, compute the GCD of the lengths of the two strings.- Return the substring of either str1 or str2 up to that GCD length.Because in the case where the concatenation is equal, then the common divisor must be the GCD length. Let's test this logic against the examples.Example 1: str1 = \\"ABCABC\\" (length 6), str2 = \\"ABC\\" (length 3). GCD(6,3)=3. So x is \\"ABC\\". Check if ABC divides both. Yes. Correct.Example 2: str1 length 6, str2 length 4. GCD is 2. The substring of length 2 is \\"AB\\". Which works. Correct.Example 3: concatenation would be \\"LEETCODE\\" vs \\"CODELEET\\", which are different. So return empty. Correct.Example 4: str1 is \\"ABCDEF\\" (length 6), str2 is \\"ABC\\" (length 3). GCD is 3. The substring would be \\"ABC\\". But does that divide both? Let's see. str1 is ABCDEF. ABC repeated twice would be ABCABC, which is longer than ABCDEF. So no. But according to the example, the output is \\"\\". So according to the algorithm, the first check would be str1+str2 vs str2+str1. Let's compute that.str1 is ABCDEF, str2 is ABC. str1 + str2 is ABCDEFABC. str2 + str1 is ABCABCDEF. These are not equal, so the algorithm returns \\"\\", which matches the example. So the initial check is necessary.So the steps are correct.So the code steps would be:1. Check if str1 + str2 is equal to str2 + str1. If not, return \\"\\".2. If they are equal, compute the GCD of the lengths of the two strings.3. Take the substring of either str1 or str2 (since they are compatible) up to that length.But why does the GCD of the lengths ensure that the substring is a divisor? Let's see.The GCD length is the largest possible divisor of both lengths. Suppose len1 = m, len2 = n. The GCD is g. So m = a * g, n = b * g, where a and b are coprime. Since the concatenation check passes, the strings are made up of the same repeating unit. So the maximum possible x is of length g.But how to confirm that the substring up to g is indeed the divisor?Because if the concatenation check passes, then the entire strings are built from the same base string. So the base string is x, and the length of x must divide both len1 and len2. Therefore, the maximum possible length is the GCD. So the substring up to the GCD length would be x.So the code can be written as:First, check if str1 + str2 equals str2 + str1. If not, return empty. Otherwise, compute the GCD of the lengths, then take the first GCD characters from either string.So in Python, the code would look like:def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:    if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:        return \\"\\"    from math import gcd    max_length = gcd(len(str1), len(str2))    return str1[:max_length]Wait, that's it? Let me test with the examples.Example 1: str1 is ABCABC, str2 is ABC. Concatenation check passes. GCD(6,3)=3. str1[:3] is ABC. Correct.Example 2: GCD(6,4)=2. str1[:2] is AB. Correct.Example 3: returns empty.Example4: returns empty.Yes, seems correct. But wait, why does the substring up to GCD length work? Because the entire string is made of that substring. For example, in example 2, AB repeated 3 times is ABABAB (str1), and AB repeated 2 times is ABAB (str2). So the GCD is 2, and the substring is AB.So the code seems correct.So the code uses math.gcd, but note that in Python versions before 3.5, math.gcd may not handle zero, but here the constraints say that the lengths are at least 1, so it's safe. Also, for Python 3, the gcd function returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.Thus, the code should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest string that can divide both input strings \`str1\` and \`str2\` when concatenated multiple times.

Concatenation Check: The check \`str1 + str2 != str2 + str1\` ensures that both strings are composed of the same repeating unit. If they are not, there is no possible common divisor string.2. GCD Calculation: The GCD of the lengths of \`str1\` and \`str2\` determines the longest possible length of the common divisor string. This is because the GCD is the largest number that can divide both lengths, ensuring that the divisor string can be repeated to form both input strings.3. Substring Extraction: Using the GCD length, we extract the substring from either \`str1\` or \`str2\` up to this length. This substring is guaranteed to be the largest possible common divisor due to the prior checks and calculations.This approach efficiently combines mathematical insights with string operations to solve the problem in linear time relative to the input string lengths, making it both optimal and easy to understand."},{"problem":"Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive). Example 1:Input: low = 3, high = 7Output: 3Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].Example 2:Input: low = 8, high = 10Output: 1Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9]. Constraints:0 <= low <= high <= 10^9","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to write a Python function called countOdds that takes two integers, low and high, and returns the count of odd numbers between them, inclusive. Let's think about how to approach this problem.Hmm, first, the straightforward way would be to check every number from low to high and count how many are odd. But wait, the constraints say that low and high can be up to 1e9. If low is 0 and high is 1e9, iterating through each number would take way too long and be inefficient. So that's not feasible. Need a mathematical approach here.So, the key is to find a formula that gives the number of odds between low and high without checking each number. Let's recall some math here. The count of numbers between two numbers inclusive is high - low + 1. Then, the number of odds depends on whether the count is even or odd, and the parity of the starting and ending numbers.Alternatively, the number of odd numbers in the range from a to b (inclusive) can be calculated as follows:If the total numbers (count) is even, then half of them are odd. If it's odd, then it depends on whether the first or last number is odd. For example, from 3 to 7 (count is 5 numbers). 3,5,7 are odd, which is (5+1)/2 =3. From 8 to 10: 3 numbers. Only 9 is odd: (3+0)/2 =1.5, but wait, maybe another approach.Wait, another approach: the number of odds between 0 and n inclusive is (n+1)//2. Because for every two numbers, there's one odd. For example, 0-0: (0+1)//2 = 0.5 floored to 0. But wait, 0 is even. 0-1: (1+1)//2 =1. Correct (only 1 is odd). 0-3: (3+1)/2=2, which is 1 and 3. So yes.So if we can find the number of odds up to high, subtract the number of odds up to low-1, that would give the count between low and high inclusive.So the formula would be: count_odds(high) - count_odds(low - 1).But what is count_odds(n)? It's (n +1 ) // 2. Let me verify.Take n=3: (3+1)//2 =2. Correct (1,3). n=7: (7+1)/2=4. So 1,3,5,7. Which is 4 numbers. But the first example had low=3 and high=7. So the count would be 3. Wait, according to the formula, count_odds(7) - count_odds(2) =4 -1=3. Which matches example 1. For example 2: high=10, low=8. count_odds(10)=5 (since (10+1)//2=5.5, floor is 5.5? Wait wait, no. Wait (10 +1) is 11, divided by 2 is 5.5. But integer division in Python is 5. So (n+1)//2 for n=10: (10+1)//2=11//2=5 (since 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, floor is 5). So numbers 1,3,5,7,9 are the odds up to 10. Then count_odds(10) - count_odds(7) =5 -4=1. Which matches example 2. Wait, but wait, in example 2, low is 8, high is 10. So low-1 is 7. So count_odds(10) is 5, count_odds(7) is (7+1)//2=4. So 5-4=1, correct.So the formula works. So the general approach is:Compute the number of odds from 0 to high, subtract the number of odds from 0 to low-1.So the steps are:1. Compute count_high = (high +1) // 22. Compute count_low = (low) // 2Because low-1 could be negative if low is 0. Wait, when low is 0, low-1 is -1. Then (low-1 +1)//2 = 0//2=0. So count_odds(low-1) is 0 when low is 0.So yes. Let's test with low=0.Suppose low=0, high=0: count_high = (0+1)//2 =0.5 floored to 0. count_low = (0-1 +1)//2 =0//2=0. So 0-0=0. Correct, since 0 is even.Another example: low=0, high=3. Then count_high is (3+1)//2=2, count_low is (0) //2=0. So 2-0=2. Which is correct: 1,3.So the formula works.So putting this all together, the code can be written as:def countOdds(low, high):    count_high = (high +1) //2    count_low = (low) //2  # because (low-1 +1) is low, then divided by 2    return count_high - count_lowWait, wait. Wait, when low is 3, count_odds(low-1) is count_odds(2) which is (2+1)//2=1.5 floored to 1. But (low) //2 is 3//2=1, which is the same as (low-1 +1)//2. So yes, count_low is (low) //2.Wait, no. Let me see:count_odds(low-1) is equal to ( (low-1) +1 ) //2 → which is low//2. So yes. So count_odds(low-1) = (low) // 2.So the formula is correct.So the code can be written as:return ( (high +1) //2 ) - ( low //2 )That's even simpler.So for example 1: high=7 → (7+1)//2=4. low=3 →3//2=1. 4-1=3. Correct.Example 2: high=10 → (10+1)//2=5. low=8 →8//2=4. 5-4=1. Correct.Another test case: low=2, high=2. (2+1)//2=1 (since 3//2=1.5 becomes 1 in integer division). low is 2//2=1. 1-1=0. Correct, since 2 is even.Another test case: low=1, high=1. (1+1)//2=1. low//2=0. 1-0=1. Correct.So this formula seems to work.So the code can be written as:class Solution:    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:        return (high +1) // 2 - low //2That's it. This should handle all cases efficiently, even for very large numbers. Since it's O(1) time, it's acceptable for the constraints.I think this is the correct approach. Let me think of some edge cases.Edge case 1: low=0, high=0 → 0. Correct.Edge case 2: low=0, high=1 → 1. (1//2=0, (1+1)//2=1. 1-0=1. Correct: 1 is the only odd.Edge case 3: low=2, high=3 → (3+1)//2=2, low//2=1. 2-1=1. Numbers 3, correct.Another case: low=9, high=11. Odds are 9,11 → count is 2. (11+1)/2=6. 9//2=4. 6-4=2. Correct.Yes, this formula works.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the count of odd numbers between two non-negative integers \`low\` and \`high\` (inclusive).

ApproachThe key insight here is to use a mathematical approach to count the odd numbers efficiently without iterating through each number in the range. 1. Understanding the Count of Odds in a Range:    - The number of odd numbers from 0 to a number \`n\` can be calculated as ((n + 1) // 2).

Let's think about how to approach this.Hmm, so the steps are straightforward for each number. For example, with 14: each step depends on whether the current number is even or odd. Let's see. So the process is iterative. For each step, check the number, perform the operation, count the step. Repeat until the number becomes zero.Wait, but maybe there's a way to do this without actually simulating each step. Like, using bit manipulation or mathematical operations to calculate the steps more efficiently, especially since the number can be up to 1e6. But for now, let's just think of the straightforward approach first.The straightforward method would be to initialize a counter at 0, then loop while the number is greater than zero. For each iteration, check if the number is even. If even, divide by 2. If odd, subtract 1. Increment the counter each time. Once the loop ends (number is zero), return the counter.Let me test this logic against the examples.Example 1: 14. Let's see:Step 1: 14 even, divide by 2 →7 (step count 1)Step 2: 7 odd, subtract 1 →6 (step count 2)Step 3:6 even →3 (step 3)Step4:3 subtract →2 (step4)Step5:2 →1 (step5)Step6:1 →0 (step6). Total 6 steps. Correct.Similarly, example 2: 8. Steps would be 8 →4 →2 →1 →0. Wait, wait, 8 divided by 2 is 4 (step1), then 4→2 (step2), 2→1 (step3), then subtract 1 (step4). So yes, 4 steps.So the straightforward approach works for these examples. Now, what about numbers like 0? Well, the input is non-negative, including zero. But if num is zero, the steps would be 0. Let's make sure the code handles that.Another example: num=1. It's odd, subtract 1 →0. Steps:1. Correct.Another case: num=3. Steps would be 3→2 (step1, subtract), 2→1 (step2, divide?), wait no. Wait 2 is even. Wait 3 is odd: subtract 1 →2 (step1). Then 2 is even →1 (step2). Then 1 is odd →0 (step3). So total 3 steps.So the code should handle that.Now, implementing this in Python. The function is called numberOfSteps, part of a Solution class. So the code would look like:def numberOfSteps(self, num: int) -> int:    steps = 0    while num > 0:        if num % 2 == 0:            num = num // 2        else:            num -= 1        steps +=1    return stepsWait, but why use integer division? Because dividing even numbers by two will result in an integer. But in Python, using / would give a float. So for example, 14/2 is 7.0. Then in the next step, when we check 7.0 % 2, that would be 1.0. But when the number becomes a float, but in the code above, since we are using num = num // 2 for even numbers, maybe it's better to use integer division.Wait, in the code above, if num is even, we do num = num // 2. Which is correct. Because for even numbers, division by two gives an integer. For example, 6//2 is 3, which is correct.Wait, but in Python, when you divide an even integer by 2, using / would give a float, but using // gives integer. So to keep num as an integer, using // is better. So the code would work correctly.Let me test with the code for example 1:num=14, steps=0.Loop starts: 14>0.14 even: 14//2 =7. steps becomes 1.Next iteration: 7>0. It's odd. Subtract 1 →6. steps=2.Next:6 even →3. steps=3.3 odd →2. steps=4.2 even →1. steps=5.1 odd →0. steps=6.Loop ends. Return 6. Correct.So the code works.Now, what about the case when num is 0? The loop doesn't run, returns 0. Which is correct.What about num=123? The code would need to compute 12 steps. Let's see how it works. Let's think of 123 in binary. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern with binary digits. For example, each time you subtract 1 from an odd number (which is equivalent to flipping the least significant 1 bit), and each even step divides by two (equivalent to shifting right). So the number of steps would be equal to the number of 1 bits plus the number of bits minus 1. Because each 1 (except the leading 1) contributes a subtract (which takes one step) and a division (but the division steps would be the number of shifts needed). Wait, maybe there's a more efficient way.But since the problem allows for numbers up to 1e6, the straightforward approach of O(log n) steps is acceptable. For 1e6, log2 is about 20, so each number would take up to 20 steps. So even in the worst case, 1e6 numbers would be manageable. So the straightforward approach is acceptable.Thus, the code should work correctly.But let's check the example 3. Input 123, output 12.Let's simulate the code:num=123, steps=0.Loop 1: 123 is odd. subtract 1 →122. steps=1.Loop 2: 122 even. 61. steps=2.Loop 3: 61 odd →60. steps=3.Loop4:60 even →30. steps4.Loop5:30→15. steps5.Loop6:15→14. steps6.Loop7:14→7. steps7.Loop8:7→6. steps8.Loop9:6→3. steps9.Loop10:3→2. steps10.Loop11:2→1. steps11.Loop12:1→0. steps12.

Correct.So the code works.Therefore, the code should be correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of steps required to reduce a non-negative integer to zero.

(And the substring \\"abcabc\\" twice.)","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed by repeating a substring multiple times. Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.First, let's understand the examples. For \\"abab\\", the substring is \\"ab\\" repeated twice. So the length of the string must be a multiple of the substring's length. So the first idea is that the substring length must divide the original string's length.So for any string s, if there exists a substring t such that s is t repeated k times (k >= 2), then the length of t must be a divisor of len(s). For example, len(\\"abab\\") is 4, and the possible divisors could be 1, 2, 4. But since k has to be at least 2, the maximum possible t length is len(s)/2. So for a string of length n, possible candidates for the substring length are divisors of n up to n/2.So the plan is: check all possible divisors of the string's length. For each divisor d (where d is a divisor of n and d <= n/2), check if the substring of length d repeated (n/d) times equals the original string.But how do I generate all possible divisors up to n/2?Alternatively, instead of finding all divisors, maybe iterate from 1 to n//2, and for each possible d where d divides n, check if the substring s[0:d] repeated n/d times equals s.Wait, but how do I check for all possible d that divide the length of s?For example, if the length is 6, possible divisors are 1,2,3,6. But since we need k >=2, the maximum possible divisor is 3 (since 6/3=2 times). So we can loop d from 1 to len(s)//2, and check if len(s) is divisible by d. If it is, then check if s is made up of s[0:d] repeated len(s)/d times.So the steps would be:1. Get the length of the string, n.2. For each possible d in 1 to n//2 (inclusive):   a. If n % d != 0, skip this d.   b. Else, check if the substring s[0:d] repeated (n/d) times equals s.3. If any of these checks pass, return True. Otherwise, return False.But wait, this might be inefficient if n is large (like 10^4) and there are a lot of divisors to check. But given that n is up to 10^4, even a O(n^2) approach might be acceptable here. Because for each d up to 5000 (if n is 10^4), but for each d, the check is O(n) (since you're creating a string of length n). So the worst case is O(n^2) for n=1e4, which is 1e8 operations. That's probably too slow. Wait, but 1e8 operations might be too much for Python, but maybe there's a smarter way.Alternatively, there's a clever mathematical approach. For example, if the string can be constructed by repeating a substring, then the concatenation of two copies of the string (s + s) would contain the original string in the middle. But wait, maybe there's a trick where if you remove the first and last character of the concatenated string, you can check if the original string is a substring. Let me think.I remember a solution where if you concatenate s + s, then remove the first and last characters, and check if s is present in this new string, then it means that s can be formed by a repeated substring. Let me see why.Take s = \\"abab\\". Then s + s is \\"abababab\\". Removing first and last characters gives \\"bababa\\". Now, the original s is \\"abab\\", which is present in \\"bababa\\"? Wait, \\"abab\\" is of length 4. The modified string is \\"bababa\\" which is 6 characters. So \\"abab\\" would be from index 1: \\"abab\\" in \\"bababa\\"? Let's see:Original s: abab (len 4)s + s is abababab (len 8). Remove first and last character: bababa (len 6). Now check if 'abab' is in 'bababa'? Let's see: 'baba' is first four letters, then 'abab' starts at index 1: 'a' at 1, 'b' at 2, etc. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps this approach works for some other reason.Wait, maybe the idea is that if s can be divided into k parts, then in the doubled string, the original s starts at index len(substring). So for example, if s is 'abab' (substring 'ab' repeated twice), then s + s is 'abababab'. If we remove the first character (a) and the last character (b), we get 'bababa'. Then, checking if 'abab' is in this string. Hmm, 'bababa' is 'b a b a b a'. So the original s is 'abab' which is present starting at index 1: 'a b a b' is not possible here. Wait, maybe this approach isn't correct.Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that if the original string s can be formed by a repeated substring, then the s must be a substring of (s + s)[1:-1]. Let's test this with examples.Example 1: s = \\"abab\\". s + s is \\"abababab\\". (s + s)[1:-1] is \\"bababa\\". Does \\"abab\\" appear in this substring? Let's see: the substring is \\"b a b a b a\\". The original s is a b a b. So from index 1: a is index 1, then b at 2, a at 3, b at 4. So \\"abab\\" is present starting at index 1. So yes.Another example: \\"aba\\". s + s is \\"abaaba\\". (s + s)[1:-1] is \\"baab\\". Check if \\"aba\\" is in \\"baab\\". The answer is no, so it returns false.Third example: \\"abcabcabcabc\\". s + s is \\"abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc\\". [1:-1] is \\"bcabcabcabcabcabcabca\\". Checking if the original s is present in this substring. Well, the original s is 12 characters. The substring is 22 characters. So yes, the original s would be present.So this seems to work. The logic here is that if s can be constructed by repeating a substring t, then s is t + t + ... + t (k times). When you concatenate s + s, you get t repeated 2k times. If you remove the first and last characters, then you have a string that is t repeated 2k-2 times plus some parts. Wait, maybe not. But the idea is that the original s must appear in the middle of s + s. For example, if s is t * k, then s + s is t * 2k. By removing the first and last characters, you eliminate the possibility of taking the entire first or entire second s. So the remaining string must contain at least one full s made up of the t's. Therefore, if s is made up of a repeated substring, then s must be present in (s + s)[1:-1]. So checking if s is a substring of (s + s)[1:-1] would be sufficient.This approach would be O(n) time, since concatenation and substring checking can be done in linear time (depending on the implementation). So for large n (like 1e4), this would be efficient.So the code for this approach would be:return s in (s + s)[1:-1]But wait, in Python, checking if a substring is present is O(n) on average, but worst case O(n*m) where m is the length of the substring. So for s of length 1e4, (s + s)[1:-1] is 2*1e4 - 2 = 19998 characters. Checking if s is in this string would be O(n*m) which is 1e4 * 2e4 = 2e8 operations. That's possible but maybe not the best, but given that Python is efficient with string operations, this might be manageable.Alternatively, the first approach of checking possible divisors could be optimized. Let's see.For the first approach:n = len(s)for d in divisors of n (from 1 to n//2):   if s[:d] repeated (n/d) times == s: return Truereturn FalseHow to find all possible d's?We can loop d from 1 to n//2, and check if n % d == 0. For each such d, check if the substring s[0:d] multiplied by (n/d) equals s.But for each d, this check is O(n) because you create a new string of length n. So in the worst case, for n=1e4, this could be O(n^2) time. For example, if n is a prime number like 9973 (but 1e4 is 10000, which is even). So the worst case would be O(n^2) for numbers with a lot of divisors, but maybe in practice it's manageable.But for n=1e4, the loop would run up to 5000 iterations. For each d in 1 to 5000, if n mod d is 0. For example, for n=12, divisors are 1,2,3,4,6. For each of these, check the substring.So the code would look like:def repeatedSubstringPattern(s):    n = len(s)    for d in range(1, n//2 + 1):        if n % d == 0:            substring = s[0:d]            if substring * (n//d) == s:                return True    return FalseBut this may have better performance than the first approach for some cases, and worse for others.Let me test this approach with the examples.Example 1: \\"abab\\" (n=4). Check d from 1 to 2.d=1: 4%1=0. substring is 'a'. 'a'*4 is 'aaaa' != 'abab' → continue.d=2: 4%2=0. substring 'ab' → 'abab' equals s → return True.So correct.Example 2: \\"aba\\" (n=3). d can be 1 only (3//2 is 1).d=1: 3%1=0. substring 'a' → 'aaa' != 'aba' → return False. Correct.Example3: \\"abcabcabcabc\\" (n=12). Check d up to 6.d=1: 12%1=0. 'a'*12 → no.d=2: 12%2=0. substring 'ab' → 'ab'*6 is 'abababababab' → not equal to original.d=3: yes. 'abc' *4 → equals s → return True. So correct.So this approach works for the examples.Which approach is better? Well, the first approach (checking divisors) may be more efficient in cases where there's a small divisor that works early. For example, for a string made of a 2-length substring, the loop would exit at d=2. The second approach (checking (s + s)[1:-1]) is O(n) for the substring check. But how does it compare in time?For a string that's made of a substring of length n/2, the first approach would check d=1, then d=2, ..., until d reaches n/2. But in the worst case, for example, if the correct substring is n/2, the first approach would have to check O(n) divisors (but in reality, the number of divisors is O(sqrt(n))), but depends on the number.Alternatively, the (s + s)[1:-1] approach is a one-liner and could be more efficient for large n where the correct substring is small. Let's see: creating the concatenated string is O(n), then the check is O(n). So overall O(n) time.But why does the (s + s)[1:-1] approach work?Let's think of the theory.If s can be constructed by repeating a substring t k times (k>=2), then s = t*k.s + s = t*k + t*k = t*(2k). If we remove the first character and the last character, we get a string that starts from the second character of t and ends at the second last character of t*(2k). For example, if t is 'ab', k=2: s is 'abab'. s + s is 'abababab'. Removing first and last gives 'bababa'. Now, the original s is 'abab', which can be found starting at index 1 of 'bababa' (the substring is 'abab').But how does this ensure that the original s is present in (s + s)[1:-1]?Because the s is part of the middle of s + s. So, for example, s = t*k. Then s + s is t*(2k). If we remove the first and last character, we get (t[1:] + t*(2k-2) + t[:-1]). Then the original s would start at position len(t) - 1 in the concatenated string. For example:t = 'abc', k=3 → s is 'abcabcabc'. s + s is 'abcabcabcabcabcabc'. Removing first and last characters gives 'bcabcabcabcabcabca'. The original s is 'abcabcabc' which is 9 characters. Let's see if it's present. The substring from position 2 (after removing the first 'a') would have 'bcabcabca...' and the original s starts at some position. Maybe not, but perhaps the idea is that there's an occurrence of s in the middle of s + s after removing first and last characters.Alternatively, the theory is that if s can be divided into multiple copies of a substring, then the concatenated s + s will contain another occurrence of s starting at position 1 (after the first character). So after removing the first and last characters, the original s is present.But I'm not entirely sure. Let's test this.Take s = 'ababab' (t = 'ab', k=3). s + s = 'abababababab'. Remove first and last: 'babababababa'. Original s is 'ababab', which should be in this new string. Let's check: the new string is 'b a b a b a b a b a b a' (length 10). The original s is 6 characters. Looking for 'ababab' in this string. The substring from index 1: 'a b a b a b' → yes. So it is present.Another example: s = 'aaa'. s + s = 'aaaaaa'. Remove first and last: 'aaaa'. s is 'aaa', which is present in 'aaaa' (positions 0-2, 1-3).But if s is 'a', then len(s) is 1. Then the possible k is 2. But according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty, but for the code, the function would return false for len(s) = 1, but according to the problem's condition, the input is non-empty. Wait, the problem says \\"non-empty string\\". So the code should handle len(s) =1, but in that case, the answer is false since k must be >=2, but for s of length 1, there's no way to have a substring of length d where d <= 0.5 (since 1//2 is 0). So the code for the first approach would return false.But according to the (s + s)[1:-1] approach, for s='a', (s + s) is 'aa', removing first and last characters (which would be 'a' and 'a'), gives an empty string. So s='a' is not in the empty string, so the function returns false. Which is correct.So the (s + s)[1:-1] approach seems to work.But how to code this?In Python:def repeatedSubstringPattern(s):    return s in (s + s)[1:-1]That's it. But why does this work?Because if s can be formed by a repeated substring, then the s must appear in the middle of s + s. For example, if s is t*k, then s + s is t*2k. When you remove the first and last characters, you get (t*2k)[1:-1], which is t[1:] + t*(2k-2) + t[:-1]. Then the original s (t*k) must be present in this string.In contrast, if s is not made up of a repeated substring, then (s + s)[1:-1] will not contain s. For example, s='aba', s + s is 'abaaba', after removing first and last, 'baab'. 'aba' is not in 'baab'.So this approach is clever and efficient. Let's test some edge cases.Case when s is length 2. s = 'aa' → returns True. Because 'a' is the substring. According to the code: (s + s) is 'aaaa', [1:-1] is 'aa', which contains 'aa' → True.Another case: s='aaaaa' (length 5). The possible d is 1, since 5//2=2. But 5%1=0. The substring 'a' repeated 5 times is s. So the code (s + s)[1:-1] is 'aaaaa aaaa' → no, wait, s + s is 'aaaaaaaaaa' (10 a's). [1:-1] is 8 a's. So s is 'aaaaa' (5 a's). So 'aaaaa' is present in 'aaaaaaaa' → yes. So code returns True. Which is correct.Wait, but in reality, 'aaaaa' can be made by 'a' repeated 5 times. So the code returns True. So the code works here.Another edge case: s='ababab' (length 6). The code checks if s is in (s+s)[1:-1]. s+s is 'abababababab', removing first and last gives 'bababababa' (length 10). The original s is 'ababab' (6 letters). Looking in 'bababababa' for 'ababab'... the substring starts at index 1: 'aba' is at 1, but wait:s is 'ababab' (positions 0-5). s+s is 'abababababab' (0-11). [1:-1] is positions 1-10: 'bababababa'.Looking for 'ababab' in 'bababababa'. Let's see:positions 1-6 of s+s is 'ababab' (original s). But wait, in the [1:-1] substring, the original s is 'ababab', which is present? Let's see:Original s + s is 'abababababab', [1:-1] is 'bababababa' (length 10). The original s is 6 characters. So the substring can be found starting at index 1: 'ababab'?Wait, the [1:-1] is 'b a b a b a b a b a' (each 'ba' pair). Wait, the letters are:Indices 0: b1: a2: b3: a4: b5: a6: b7: a8: b9: aSo looking for 'ababab' in this. The substring starts at index 1: a b a b a b → which is the original s. So yes, present. So code returns True.So this approach seems to work.Now, which approach is better? The (s + s)[1:-1] approach is much shorter and efficient in terms of code length, but what about time and space?For a string of length 1e4, the concatenated string is 2e4 characters. Then [1:-1] makes a string of 19998 characters. Then checking if s is a substring is O(n) on average (using the KMP algorithm under the hood in Python's in operator). So this approach is O(n) time and O(n) space.The first approach (checking divisors) can be O(n^2) in the worst case. For example, when the string is all 'a's. Then for each possible divisor d (up to n//2), it will check and create the substring. For n=1e4, the number of divisors is up to 100 (since 1e4 has divisors up to 100), but creating a string of size 1e4 each time could take O(n) per check. So 100 * 1e4 = 1e6 operations, which is manageable.But for strings like 'a' * 1e4, the code will check all possible divisors and for each d, create a substring of 'a' * d and multiply. But since all are a's, all checks after the first d=1 will be O(1) since the first check (d=1) returns True. Wait no: for d=1, the substring is 'a', multiplied by 1e4 times gives the original string, which would return True. So the loop stops at d=1.But in this case, the first approach is O(n), and the second approach is O(n). But the first approach would have to loop once (d=1) and check the substring once. So for such a case, both approaches are efficient.But for a case where the correct d is large, like n/2. For example, s = 'abababab' (n=8, d=4). The first approach would loop d up to 4. For each divisor of 8 (1,2,4, but since 8//2 is 4, d runs up to 4). So checks d=1 (8%1=0, substring 'a' *8 → 'aaaaaaaa' != 'abababab' → no. Then d=2: 8%2=0 → substring 'ab' *4 → 'abababab' → yes. So returns True. So in this case, the loop runs 2 steps.In the second approach, it's a one-liner. So depends on how efficient the in operator is in Python.So which approach is better in terms of code and efficiency?The second approach is much simpler and concise, but may have a higher space overhead. However, for Python, the in operator is optimized, and the code is O(n) time and O(n) space.So the answer is to use the second approach.Thus, the Python code would be:class Solution:    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:        return s in (s + s)[1:-1]But wait, let's test this code for some cases.Test case 1: \\"abab\\" → (s+s)[1:-1] is \\"abababab\\" → removing first and last characters gives \\"bababa\\". So the new string is \\"bababa\\". Does \\"abab\\" appear in it? Let's see:\\"bababa\\" is 6 characters. \\"abab\\" is 4. Starting at index 1: 'a b a b' → yes. So returns True.Test case 2: \\"aba\\" → (s+s)[1:-1] is \\"baab\\". Does \\"aba\\" exist in \\"baab\\"? No. So returns False.Test case 3: \\"abcabcabcabc\\" → len is 12. (s+s)[1:-1] is the concatenated string minus first and last character. The original s is 12 characters. The new string is 24-2=22 characters. Does s exist in this string? Let's see: the new string is s+s starting from index 1 and ending at index 22. For s = t*4 (t is 'abc'), s+s is t*8. The substring [1:-1] is from index 1 to 22-1=21. The original s starts at index 3 (len(t) -1 = 3-1=2? Not sure, but 'abcabcabcabc' would be found in the middle. So returns True.Another test case: s = 'a' → returns False.Another case: s = 'aaaaa' → (s+s) is 'aaaaaaaaaa', [1:-1] is 'aaaaaaaa' (len 8). 'aaaaa' is present here (positions 0-4, but that's only 5 characters. Wait, 'aaaaaaaa' is 8 a's. So 'aaaaa' is present as a substring from 0 to 4, then from 1 to 5, etc. So returns True, which is correct.Thus, the code works.But wait, what if the string is made up of a substring that is repeated 3 times? Like 'abcabcabc'. Then the code would return True. Let's see:s = 'abcabcabc' → len 9. (s+s) is 'abcabcabcabcabcabc' → len 18. [1:-1] is len 16. The original s is 9 characters. Does 'abcabcabc' appear in the new string? The new string is 'bcabcabcabcabcabca' (assuming s + s starts with 'abcabcabcabcabcabc', removing first and last gives from index 1 to 16. So the substring would be present in the middle. So yes.Thus, the code seems correct.So the final answer is the code using the (s + s)[1:-1] approach.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given non-empty string can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of that substring together.

Let's think about how to approach this.First, let's understand the examples. In the first example, the input is [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]. The output is 2 because 12 has two digits (even) and 7896 has four. The other numbers have 3, 1, and 1 digits, which are odd. So the task is to count all elements in the array that have an even number of digits.Hmm, how do I determine the number of digits in a number? Well, one way is to convert the number to a string and check the length. For example, str(12) gives '12', len is 2. That's straightforward. Another way is to use mathematical operations. Like, for a number n, if it's 0, it has 1 digit. Otherwise, we can count how many times we can divide by 10 before it becomes 0. For example, 12 divided by 10 once becomes 1.2, then integer division would be 1. Divided again by 10 gives 0. So two digits. That's another method.So which method is better? Converting to a string might be simpler and more readable. Since performance isn't a big concern here because the constraints are up to 500 elements, which is manageable. So maybe the string approach is easier to implement.So for each number in the nums array, convert it to a string, get the length, and check if that length is even. If yes, increment a counter.Wait, but what about negative numbers? The problem statement says \\"given an array nums of integers\\". But the constraints say nums[i] is between 1 and 1e5. So all numbers are positive. So no need to handle negative signs. That's good.So the steps are:1. Initialize a counter to 0.2. Iterate over each number in the nums array.3. For each number, convert it to a string, find the length.4. If the length is even, increment the counter.5. Return the counter.Let's test this logic against the examples.First example: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]12 → '12' → length 2 → even → count +=1.345 → 3 → odd → no.2 → 1 → no.6 → 1 → no.7896 → 4 → yes. Total 2. Correct.Second example: nums = [555,901,482,1771]555 → 3 → no.901 → 3 → no.482 → 3 → no.1771 → 4 → yes. So count is 1. Correct.So this approach works for the examples.Now, code-wise. The function is called findNumbers and takes a list of integers. We need to loop through each number.In Python, converting each num to string is easy. So for num in nums: s = str(num), then len(s) % 2 == 0.So the code would be something like:def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:    count = 0    for num in nums:        if len(str(num)) % 2 == 0:            count +=1    return countWait, but what about numbers that are zero? According to constraints, nums[i] is at least 1. So zero is not present. So no problem.What about the number 10? That's two digits, which is even. So it would be counted.Another test case: nums = [10, 100, 1000]. Those have 2, 3, 4 digits. So counts are 2 (10 and 1000). So code would return 2.But what if the number is 0? len(str(0)) is 1, but according to constraints, it's not present.So the code should work.Alternative approach using mathematical calculation:For a number n, the number of digits can be found by:digits = 0while n > 0:    n = n // 10    digits +=1But for n=0, it's a special case. But since our nums are >=1, we can ignore that.So for each number, we can compute the digits as:def count_digits(n):    if n ==0:        return 1    count =0    while n>0:        n = n//10        count +=1    return countThen, check if count is even.But is this method faster? For numbers up to 1e5, which is 5 digits, the loop will run at most 5 times. So negligible difference. But for code brevity, converting to string is better.Therefore, the code using the string method is sufficient.Thus, the function is as written above. Let's make sure there are no edge cases.For example, a number with 2 digits: 10 → yes. What about 9999 → 4 digits → yes.Another edge case: nums = [1], which has 1 digit → count 0. Correct.Another example: nums = [22, 4444, 666666] → counts 3 → all even.So the code should handle these.Therefore, the code should work as intended.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many numbers in a given array contain an even number of digits.

Let me think about how to approach this.So the problem says I can buy and sell only once. The goal is to maximize the profit. But I can't sell before buying. Right. So the idea is to find two days: one to buy low and then later sell high, such that the difference is the maximum possible.Let me look at the first example. The input is [7,1,5,3,6,4]. The maximum profit is 5, which comes from buying at 1 and selling at 6. So the key is to track the minimum price encountered so far and then see what the profit would be if sold on each subsequent day.Wait, maybe the algorithm should track the minimum price up to the current day, and then calculate the profit as the current price minus that minimum. Then keep updating the maximum profit whenever a larger profit is found.Hmm. So here's the plan:1. Initialize two variables: min_price to a very large value, and max_profit to 0.2. Iterate through each price in the prices array.3. For each price, first check if it's lower than the current min_price. If yes, update min_price.4. Otherwise, calculate the profit (current price - min_price) and see if it's greater than max_profit. If yes, update max_profit.5. After processing all prices, return max_profit.Wait, but what if the prices keep decreasing? Like in example 2, where the output is 0. So if there's no possible profit, just return 0. That should be handled by the initial max_profit being 0, and if all the profits are negative, the max remains 0.Let me test this logic with example 1:Prices: 7,1,5,3,6,4Initialize min_price = infinity, max_profit=0.Day 1: price 7. min_price is updated to 7. Profit would be 0 (since same day selling not allowed? Wait, but according to the problem statement, you can't sell before buying, which means you have to buy first and sell later. So for the first day, you can't sell, so profit is 0.But in the algorithm, when processing day 1, the min_price becomes 7. Then, since the profit is 7-7=0, which is not greater than 0. So max_profit remains 0.Day 2: price 1. Since 1 < min_price (7), update min_price to 1. Now, profit is 1-1=0 again. So max_profit still 0.Day3: price5. Current price is higher than min_price. Profit is 5-1=4. Which is greater than 0. So max_profit becomes 4.Day4: price3. Profit is 3-1=2. Which is less than current max (4). So no change.Day5: price6. Profit 6-1=5. Max becomes 5.Day6: price4. Profit 4-1=3. No change.So returns 5. Which matches the example.Another test case: example 2, prices [7,6,4,3,1]. Each day, the price is lower than the previous. So min_price updates each day. But since each day's price is lower than the previous, the profit for each day after buying would be negative, except when the same day (which is not allowed). So the max_profit remains 0.What if the list is empty? According to the problem statement, probably the input is at least length 1, but maybe need to handle empty. But the problem says it's an array, so maybe the code should handle when there are zero elements. But according to the sample inputs, perhaps the function is expected to return 0 in such cases.Now, let's think about possible edge cases.Case where all prices are the same. Like [5,5,5]. Then the max profit is 0. Because you can't sell on the same day as buying. Wait, wait. Wait, suppose you buy on day 1 (price 5), then sell on day 2 (price5). Profit is 0. But according to the problem, is that allowed? The problem says you can't sell before buying. So buying on day i and selling on day j where j>i. So profit can be zero if you buy and sell on the same price but different days. But according to the problem's note, \\"selling price needs to be larger than buying price.\\" Wait, example 1's explanation says that selling price needs to be larger than buying price. So if you buy and sell on the same price, it's not considered as a valid transaction, hence the profit is zero (no transaction done). Wait, but the example 1 says that the output is 5, and not 6-1=6, which is probably a typo. Wait, the explanation says \\"Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.\\" Wait, no, 7 is the first day, then 1 is day 2. So buying on day 2 and selling on day 5 gives 6-1=5. But the example says that 7-1 is not possible because you can't sell before buying. Oh right. So the key is that you must buy before selling. So in the case where all prices are the same, the maximum profit is zero because you can't make any profit. Because buying and selling would result in zero profit, but according to the problem's note, the selling price needs to be larger than buying price. Wait, wait the problem's note says \\"you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.\\" The note in example 1 says \\"selling price needs to be larger than buying price.\\" So perhaps the problem requires that the selling price is strictly larger than the buying price. Otherwise, the profit is considered as zero. So in that case, if all prices are same, then the maximum profit is zero.So in the algorithm, whenever the profit (current price - min_price) is positive, we take it. Otherwise, the max_profit remains zero.So the algorithm correctly handles that.Now, coding this in Python.The function is part of a class Solution. The method is maxProfit, which takes a list of integers called prices and returns an integer.Initialize min_price as a very large number (like float('inf')), and max_profit as 0.Loop through each price in the prices:- If the price is less than min_price, update min_price to this price.- Else, compute the profit (price - min_price). If this is greater than max_profit, update max_profit.Wait, but what about when the price is equal to min_price? Then profit is zero. But since the max_profit is initialized to zero, it's okay. Because if all prices are equal, then the max_profit remains zero.Let me test that. Suppose prices are [5,5,5]. Then the first price is 5, min_price is 5. Then next price is 5, which is not less than min_price. Profit is 0, which is not greater than current max_profit (0), so no change. Same for the third price. So max_profit remains 0.Yes.Another test case: prices [2,1,2,0,1]. Let's see. The min_price starts at infinity. First price 2: set min_price to 2. Profit is 0. Next day price 1: min_price becomes 1. Next day price 2: 2-1=1, which is higher than current max 0. So max becomes 1. Next day 0: min_price becomes 0. Next day 1: 1-0=1. Which is equal to current max. So max remains 1. So the answer is 1. Correct.So this algorithm should work.Now, code:def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:    min_price = float('inf')    max_profit = 0    for price in prices:        if price < min_price:            min_price = price        else:            profit = price - min_price            if profit > max_profit:                max_profit = profit    return max_profitWait, but this approach checks for each price. Let's see for the example [7,1,5,3,6,4].Process:price 7: min_price becomes 7. No profit.price 1: min_price becomes 1. No profit.price5: 5-1=4>0 → max_profit=4.price3: 3-1=2 → no change.price6: 6-1=5 → max_profit=5.price4: 4-1=3 → no change.Yes, correct.Another example where the best is to buy at min_price but sell at a later higher price after the min. Like [3,2,6,5,1,3]. The min_price would be 1. Then sell at 3. Profit 2. But maybe earlier buy at 2 and sell at 6 gives higher profit (4). So the algorithm would track the 6-2=4 as the max. Let's see.Let me walk through:Prices: 3,2,6,5,1,3.min_price starts as inf.price3: min becomes 3. Profit 0.price2: min becomes 2. Profit 0.price6: 6-2=4 → max becomes 4.price5: 5-2=3 → no change.price1: min becomes 1.price3: 3-1=2. Which is less than current max of 4. So max remains 4.Thus, the function returns 4, which is correct.Yes, the algorithm works.So the code seems correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock once, given the daily stock prices. The goal is to find the optimal days to buy and sell such that the profit is maximized. ApproachThe key insight to solving this problem efficiently is to track the minimum price encountered so far and compute the potential profit for each subsequent day. Here's the step-by-step approach:1. Initialize Variables: Start with \`min_price\` set to a very large value (infinity) and \`max_profit\` set to 0. These variables will help track the lowest buying price and the highest profit observed.2. Iterate Through Prices: For each price in the list:   - Update \`min_price\` if the current price is lower than the previously recorded minimum price.   - Calculate the profit if selling at the current price using the lowest price seen so far. Update \`max_profit\` if this profit is higher than the previously recorded maximum profit.3. Return Result: After processing all prices, \`max_profit\` will hold the highest possible profit.This approach ensures that we only traverse the list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of days (prices).

I need to write a Python function called xorOperation that takes two integers, n and start, and returns the XOR of all elements in the array nums. The array nums is built such that each element is start + 2*i for i from 0 to n-1. So for example, if n is 5 and start is 0, the array is [0,2,4,6,8], and the XOR of all these is 8. First, the problem seems straightforward. The steps are: generate the array, compute the XOR of all elements. But maybe there's a pattern or formula to compute this without generating the entire array, especially for larger n values. But given that n can be up to 1000, even generating the array and computing the XOR iteratively would be acceptable in terms of time complexity. So perhaps the straightforward approach is sufficient here.Let me think about how to approach this. The straightforward way is to initialize a result variable to 0, then loop from i=0 to n-1, compute each element as start + 2*i, and XOR it into the result. Then return the result. That seems simple enough.But wait, maybe there's a mathematical way to compute this more efficiently. Let's think about the XOR properties. XOR is associative and commutative, so the order doesn't matter. So the problem reduces to calculating XOR of a sequence where each term is start + 2i for i from 0 to n-1. Let's rewrite each term as (start) + 2*i. So the sequence is start, start+2, start+4, ..., start+2*(n-1).Hmm, maybe if we can model this as a series of consecutive even or odd numbers. For instance, if start is even, then all elements are even. If start is odd, all elements are odd. But not sure how that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out the 2. Let's see:Each term is start + 2i. Let's factor 2: 2*(i) + start. Wait, but start might be even or odd. Alternatively, perhaps split start into even and odd cases.Alternatively, let's think of each element as 2k + (start mod 2). For example, if start is even: start = 2k, so each term is 2k + 2i = 2(k+i). So the terms are 2*(k + i) for i from 0 to n-1. So the sequence is 2k, 2k+2, ..., 2k + 2(n-1). Which is equivalent to 2*(k), 2*(k+1), ..., 2*(k + n-1). So the XOR of these is 2 multiplied by the XOR of the numbers from k to k + n-1. Similarly, if start is odd: start = 2k +1. Then each term is 2k+1 + 2i = 2(k+i) +1. So the sequence is 2(k+i)+1 for i from 0 to n-1. Then the XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 5 ... etc., which can be written as the XOR of consecutive odd numbers. But even here, perhaps there's a formula for XOR from a to b, but I'm not sure.So, perhaps the problem can be reduced to calculating the XOR of consecutive integers and then adjusting for the 2 or the 1. Let's formalize this.Let me represent each element as 2 * m + (start & 1). Wait, no. Because start could be even or odd. Let's see:For even start: each element is even. So each element is 2*m where m ranges from start//2 to (start + 2*(n-1))//2. Since start is even, start = 2*m0. Then the elements are 2*m0, 2*(m0+1), ..., 2*(m0 + n-1). The XOR of these elements is 2 * (m0 XOR (m0+1) XOR ... XOR (m0 + n-1)). Because XOR of 2*a and 2*b is 2*(a XOR b). Because the binary representations of 2*a and 2*b are shifted left by one, so the XOR is the same as the XOR of a and b, shifted left by one. So for even start, the result is 2 * (XOR of consecutive m0 to m0 + n-1).For odd start: each element is odd. Let's write start as 2*m0 +1. Then each element is 2*m0 +1 + 2i = 2*(m0 +i) +1. So the elements are 2*(m0) +1, 2*(m0+1)+1, ..., 2*(m0 +n-1)+1. The XOR of these elements can be written as (1 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR ... XOR (2k+1)). But how to model this? Let's think: each term is 2k+1. So XORing these terms is the same as (2k) XOR (2k+1), but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps for the odd case, the XOR can be expressed in terms of the XOR from m0 to m0 +n-1, but with some adjustment. Hmm, not sure.Wait, let's try to model the odd case. Each element is 2*(m0 +i) +1. So 2*(m0 +i) is even, adding 1 makes it odd. So the XOR is (2*(m0 +i) ) XOR 1 for each term, but since XOR is applied over all terms, perhaps we can split the bits. Wait, no. Because XOR is a bitwise operation applied to all bits. For example, (a) XOR (b) is the bitwise XOR of a and b. So, the XOR of a sequence of numbers that are all 2k+1 is the same as the XOR of 2k's XORed with 1 for each term. Wait, but that's not correct. Because 2k+1 XOR 2m+1 is equal to (2k XOR 2m) XOR (1 XOR 1) which is (2(k XOR m)) XOR 0) = 2(k XOR m). But this is for two terms. For more terms, it's more complex.Alternatively, maybe for each element, since it's 2*(m0 +i) +1, the XOR of all elements can be written as (XOR of 2*(m0+i) for i in 0..n-1) XOR (XOR of 1 for each term). But that's not correct because XOR is not linear over addition. Wait, XOR is not additive. So (a + b) XOR (c + d) is not equal to (a XOR c) + (b XOR d). So this approach won't work.Hmm, perhaps the problem is easier to handle by considering the even and odd start cases separately. Let's think:Case 1: start is even. Then each element is even. So the XOR of all elements is 2 * (XOR of m0, m0+1, ..., m0 +n-1), where m0 = start//2. Because each element is 2*m, and XOR of 2a and 2b is 2*(a XOR b). So the XOR of all elements is 2 times the XOR of the m's.Case 2: start is odd. Then each element is 2k + 1, where k ranges from m0 to m0 +n-1. So each element is (2k) +1. The XOR of such numbers can be thought of as the XOR of (2k) XOR 1. Because 2k is even, adding 1 makes it odd. But again, the XOR of (a1 +1) XOR (a2 +1) XOR ... XOR (an +1) is not the same as (a1 XOR a2 XOR ... XOR an) XOR (1 XOR 1 XOR ... XOR 1). Because adding 1 to each term and XORing is different from XORing the terms and then adding 1s.So perhaps this approach is not directly applicable. So maybe the odd case can be transformed. Let me see:Each element in the odd case can be written as 2k +1. The XOR of these elements is (2k1 +1) XOR (2k2 +1) XOR ... XOR (2kn +1). Let's see for each pair: (2k +1) XOR (2m +1) = 2(k XOR m), because the least significant bit (LSB) for both is 1. When you XOR two numbers with LSB 1, the LSB becomes 0. Then the rest of the bits are the XOR of the higher bits. So (2k+1) XOR (2m+1) = 2*(k XOR m).But this is for two terms. For more terms, perhaps the pattern continues. For example, three terms: (2a+1) XOR (2b+1) XOR (2c+1). Let's compute:First two terms: 2(a XOR b). Then XOR with (2c+1). Let's see:Suppose a XOR b is d. Then 2d XOR (2c +1) = (2d ^ 2c) ^ 1. Because 2d is even, 2c is even, their XOR is even, then XOR with 1 (since 2c+1 is even plus 1). So the result is (2(d XOR c)) + 1 if the XOR of even and even is even, then plus 1. Wait, perhaps the formula is more complex.Alternatively, perhaps for the odd case, the XOR is equal to (XOR of 2k1, 2k2, ..., 2kn) XOR (1 if n is odd else 0). Because each term is 2k+1. The XOR of all terms would be the XOR of (2k1 ^ 2k2 ^ ... ^ 2kn) and (1 ^ 1 ^ ... ^ 1). Since each term contributes a 1. If there are n terms, then 1 XORed n times is 1 if n is odd, 0 if even. So the total XOR would be (2*(k1 XOR k2 XOR ... XOR kn)) XOR (n mod 2). Because each 2ki is even, and XOR of even numbers is even. Then, when you XOR with the result of the 1s, which is either 0 or 1. So the formula could be:For odd start:result = (2 * (k0 XOR (k0+1) XOR ... XOR (k0 +n-1))) XOR (n % 2)where k0 = (start - 1) // 2. Because start = 2k0 +1, so each element is 2(k0 +i) +1. So the terms k1, k2, ... are k0, k0+1, ..., k0 +n-1.So combining both cases:If start is even:result_even = 2 * xor_sum(m0, m0 +n-1)If start is odd:result_odd = (2 * xor_sum(k0, k0 +n-1)) ^ (n % 2)But how to compute xor_sum(a, b), which is the XOR of all integers from a to b inclusive?Wait, no. xor_sum(m0, m0 +n-1) is the XOR of m0, m0+1, ..., m0 +n-1. So that's a sequence of n numbers starting from m0.Wait, there is a formula for the XOR from 0 to n. For example, there's a known pattern where the XOR from 0 to n is:if n mod 4 == 0: nif n mod 4 == 1: 1if n mod 4 == 2: n+1if n mod 4 == 3: 0But how to compute the XOR from a to b? Well, it's equal to (XOR from 0 to b) XOR (XOR from 0 to a-1). Because XOR is associative and commutative, and the XOR of a sequence up to a-1 cancels out when XORed with the sequence up to b. So:xor(a, b) = xor(0, b) ^ xor(0, a-1)So, given that, we can compute the XOR from a to b using this formula.So putting it all together:If start is even:m0 = start // 2xor_m = xor(m0, m0 + n -1)result = 2 * xor_mIf start is odd:k0 = (start - 1) // 2xor_k = xor(k0, k0 + n -1)result = (2 * xor_k) ^ (n % 2)So this approach could allow us to compute the result in O(1) time, using the formula for the XOR from 0 to m.Now, the problem is to implement this.First, let's write a helper function to compute the XOR from 0 to n.def compute_xor_upto(n):    mod = n %4    if mod ==0:        return n    elif mod ==1:        return 1    elif mod ==2:        return n+1    else: # mod ==3        return 0Then, the XOR from a to b is compute_xor_upto(b) ^ compute_xor_upto(a-1).So, in the case where start is even:m0 = start //2a = m0b = m0 +n-1xor_m = compute_xor_upto(b) ^ compute_xor_upto(a-1)result = 2 * xor_mSimilarly for the odd case.So the code can be structured as follows.In the function xorOperation(n, start):if start is even:    m0 = start // 2    a = m0    b = m0 +n -1    xor_a_b = compute_xor_upto(b) ^ compute_xor_upto(a-1)    return 2 * xor_a_belse:    k0 = (start -1) //2    a = k0    b = k0 +n -1    xor_a_b = compute_xor_upto(b) ^ compute_xor_upto(a-1)    temp = 2 * xor_a_b    if n %2 ==0:        return temp    else:        return temp ^1Because when start is odd, the number of 1s is n, and 1 XORed n times is n%2. So the result is (2 * xor_a_b) XOR (n%2).So this approach avoids generating the array and computes the result in O(1) time, which is more efficient, especially for large n.Now, let's test this approach with the examples.Example 1:n=5, start=0 (even)m0=0a=0, b=0+5-1=4.XOR from 0 to4 is compute_xor_upto(4) =4 (since 4 mod4=0). XOR from 0 to -1 is 0. So 4 XOR0 =4. So result is 2*4=8. Which matches the example.Example2:n=4, start=3 (odd).k0 = (3-1)/2 =1.a=1, b=1+4-1=4.XOR from 1 to4 is compute_xor_upto(4) XOR compute_xor_upto(0).compute_xor_upto(4)=4, compute_xor_upto(0)=0. So 4 XOR0=4.So temp = 2*4=8. n is 4, even. So return 8. Which matches the example.Example3:n=1, start=7 (odd).k0=(7-1)/2=3.a=3, b=3.XOR from 3 to3 is compute_xor_upto(3) ^ compute_xor_upto(2).compute_xor_upto(3) is 0, compute_xor_upto(2) is 3. So 0 ^3=3.temp=2*3=6. n is 1, which is odd. So 6 XOR1=7. Which matches the example.Example4:n=10, start=5 (odd).k0=(5-1)/2=2.a=2, b=2+10-1=11.XOR from 2 to11:compute_xor_upto(11) is 0 (11 mod4=3). compute_xor_upto(1) is 1 (since 1 mod4=1). So 0 XOR1=1.So temp=2*1=2. n is 10 even, so return 2. Which matches the example.So all examples pass with this approach.Therefore, the code can be written as follows.Implement the helper function compute_xor_upto(n), then branch based on whether start is even or odd.Now, let's code this in Python.But in Python, we can write the helper function as a nested function or compute it inline.So the function would be:class Solution:    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:        def compute_xor_upto(m):            mod = m %4            if mod ==0:                return m            elif mod ==1:                return 1            elif mod ==2:                return m+1            else: # mod ==3                return 0                if start %2 ==0:            m0 = start //2            a = m0            b = m0 +n -1            xor_ab = compute_xor_upto(b) ^ compute_xor_upto(a-1)            return 2 * xor_ab        else:            k0 = (start -1) //2            a = k0            b = k0 +n -1            xor_ab = compute_xor_upto(b) ^ compute_xor_upto(a-1)            temp = 2 * xor_ab            if n %2 ==0:                return temp            else:                return temp ^1This should handle all cases.Another test case: when start is even but not zero. For example, start=2, n=3.nums are 2,4,6. XOR: 2^4=6, 6^6=0. So output is 0.Using the code:start is even. m0=1. a=1, b=3.xor_ab = compute_xor_upto(3) ^ compute_xor_upto(0). compute_xor_upto(3)=0, compute_xor_upto(0)=0. xor_ab=0. 2*0=0. Correct.Another test: start=1, n=2.nums are 1,3. XOR is 1^3=2.Using the code: start is odd. k0=(0)/2=0. a=0, b=1. xor_ab= compute_xor_upto(1)^compute_xor_upto(-1). compute_xor_upto(1) is 1. compute_xor_upto(-1) is 0. So xor_ab=1. temp=2*1=2. n is 2 even, so return 2. Correct.Yes, this works.So the code should handle all cases correctly.Now, the alternative approach is to loop through each element and compute the XOR step by step. Let's see which is better.The code as written with the formula is O(1) time, while the loop is O(n). But since n can be up to 1000, even a loop would be acceptable. But given the formula approach is more efficient and handles all cases correctly, the code should be implemented as above.Thus, the final answer is the Python code as written.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to compute the bitwise XOR of all elements in an array generated from a given start value and length.

So the difference is whether there are duplicate characters. So in the case where the strings are already equal, but there are at least two identical characters, then swapping those two identical characters would not change the string, hence the answer would be true. Otherwise, if all characters are unique, then you can't swap anything (since swapping would change the string), so return false.So the problem breaks down into two main scenarios:1. When A and B are not equal:   - Then, there must be exactly two positions where A and B differ.   - And, swapping the characters at those two positions in A should make it equal to B.2. When A and B are already equal:   - Then, there must be at least one character that appears at least twice in A. Because then we can swap two of those characters, which would leave the string unchanged.So the steps are:- Check if lengths are equal. If not, return false.- If A and B are the same:   - Check if there's any character that occurs at least twice. If yes, return true; else false.- Else (A and B are different):   - Find all the indices where A and B differ.   - If there are exactly two such indices, check if swapping those two in A gives B.   - Else, return false.Let's formalize this.So for the case where A and B are different:Collect all the differing positions. If the count is not exactly 2, return false. Otherwise, check if A[i] == B[j] and A[j] == B[i], where i and j are the two differing positions.For the case where A and B are same:Check if any character in A occurs at least two times. So we can count the frequency of each character. If any count is >=2, return true.Now, let's think about edge cases.Like when A and B are empty strings. Both length 0. Then, in that case, swapping two characters is impossible because there are no two characters. So in this case, the answer would be false. Wait, but according to the constraints, the length can be 0. For example, input A is \\"\\", B is \\"\\"? Then, can we swap two letters? No, because there are zero elements. So the answer should be false. Wait, but according to example 5: when A is \\"\\" and B is \\"aa\\", output is false. But when both are empty, the swap is not possible. So in that case, the answer would be false.Wait, let's see. If A and B are both empty, then they are equal. So according to the second scenario (A equals B), we need to check if there's a duplicate character. But since there are no characters, that's impossible. So return false.So that's covered.Another edge case: when the length of A and B is 1. Then even if they are equal, you can't swap two characters (since i and j must be different), so in that case, the answer is false. For example, A is \\"a\\", B is \\"a\\". Then, since length is 1, even though they are equal, you can't swap two elements (there's only one), so the answer is false.So the code steps would be:Implement the following steps:Check if len(A) != len(B): return False.If A == B:   Check if there's any character that appears at least twice.   How? Create a frequency dictionary. For each character in A, count occurrences. If any count >=2, return True. Else, return False.Else:   Find all the indices where A and B differ.   If the number of differing indices is not 2: return False.   Else, check if A[i] == B[j] and A[j] == B[i], where i and j are the two differing indices.   If yes, return True; else, False.Let me test this logic against the examples.Example 1: A = \\"ab\\", B = \\"ba\\"They are different. The differing indices are 0 and 1. Check if A[0] is B[1] (a vs a?), no. Wait, A[0] is 'a', B[1] is 'a'? Wait, B is \\"ba\\", so B[0] is 'b', B[1] is 'a'. So the differing positions are 0 and 1.Check if A[0] == B[1] (a == a) and A[1] == B[0] (b == b). Yes. So return True.Example 2: A = \\"ab\\", B = \\"ab\\". Same strings. Check if any duplicates. No, since each character is unique. So return False.Example 3: A = \\"aa\\", B = \\"aa\\". Same. Check if any character has count >=2. Yes. Return True.Example 4: A is \\"aaaaaaabc\\", B is \\"aaaaaaacb\\". The two strings differ at positions where the 'b' and 'c' are. So the differing indices are two. Check if swapping those gives the correct. So A's characters at those positions are 'b' and 'c', and B has 'c' and 'b'. So swapping them would make A equal to B. So return True.Example 5: A is empty, B is \\"aa\\". Different lengths. Return False.Another test case: A and B are length 1. A is \\"a\\", B is \\"a\\". Then same. Check frequency. Since length is 1, frequency of 'a' is 1. So return False.Another test case: A is \\"aab\\", B is \\"aab\\". Then, since there are two 'a's, return True.So the logic seems solid.Now, how to code this.Implementing in Python.First, check len(A) != len(B): return False.Then, if A == B:   Check if any character occurs at least twice. How?   We can create a frequency dictionary. Or, since it's Python, perhaps using a set. For example, if the length of the set of characters in A is less than the length of A. Because if all characters are unique, set length equals A's length. If there are duplicates, set length is less.   For example, A is \\"aa\\", set(A) is {'a'}, len is 1. len(A) is 2. So 1 < 2: yes, there's duplicates.   So in code: if len(set(A)) < len(A): return True. Else, return False.But wait: if A is empty? Then len(set(A)) is 0, len(A) is 0. So 0 <0 is False. Which is correct, because you can't swap two elements in an empty string. So in that case, returns False, which is correct.So that's a neat way to handle the same case.Else, when A and B are different:   Collect the differing indices. Let's loop through each character in A and B.   diffs = [i for i in range(len(A)) if A[i] != B[i]]   If len(diffs) != 2: return False.   Else, check A[diffs[0]] == B[diffs[1]] and A[diffs[1]] == B[diffs[0]]. If yes, return True.So putting it all together:def buddyStrings(A, B):    if len(A) != len(B):        return False    if A == B:        # Check for duplicate characters        return len(set(A)) < len(A)    else:        diffs = [i for i in range(len(A)) if A[i] != B[i]]        if len(diffs) != 2:            return False        i, j = diffs        return A[i] == B[j] and A[j] == B[i]Wait, but in Python, the function parameters are given as part of the problem. The user provided a class Solution with a method buddyStrings, so the code should fit into that.So the final code would be:class Solution:    def buddyStrings(self, A: str, B: str) -> bool:        if len(A) != len(B):            return False        if A == B:            # Check for at least one duplicate character            return len(set(A)) < len(A)        else:            # Find differing indices            diffs = []            for i in range(len(A)):                if A[i] != B[i]:                    diffs.append(i)                    if len(diffs) > 2:                        return False  # Early exit if more than 2            if len(diffs) != 2:                return False            i, j = diffs            return A[i] == B[j] and A[j] == B[i]But wait, in the code above, when collecting diffs, if during the loop the length exceeds 2, we can return False early. That's an optimization. Otherwise, collect all and check length. But in the first approach, for cases where there are more than two differences, the code would collect all and then check len(diffs) !=2. But for very long strings, this could be inefficient. So adding an early check would be better.Alternatively, the list comprehension approach:diffs = [i for i in range(len(A)) if A[i] != B[i]]But for very long strings (like 20,000 characters), this would collect all differing indices. But in the case where there are 3 differences, this would create a list of 3 elements, then check the length. But perhaps, for the worst case where the two strings are completely different (all characters differ), this could be O(n) time, which is acceptable.But considering the constraints (up to 2e4 characters), the code is O(n) in time, which is acceptable.So the code is correct.Testing all examples.Example 3: A and B are \\"aa\\". Same. len(set(A)) is 1, len(A) is 2. 1 <2 → True.Example 5: A is \\"\\", B is \\"aa\\". len(A) 0 vs 2 → return False.Another case: A is \\"a\\", B is \\"a\\". len(A) is 1. len(set(A)) is 1. 1 is not less than 1. So return False.Another case: A is \\"ab\\", B is \\"ba\\". diffs are [0,1]. Check A[0] == B[1] (a vs a?), B is \\"ba\\". B[1] is 'a', A[0] is 'a' → yes. A[1] is 'b', B[0] is 'b' → yes. So return True.Another case: A is \\"abc\\", B is \\"acb\\". The diffs are positions 1 and 2. A[1] is 'b', B[2] is 'b' → yes. A[2] is 'c', B[1] is 'c' → yes. So swapping those positions would make A equal to B. So returns True.Another case: A is \\"abcd\\", B is \\"abdc\\". diffs are 2 and 3. A[2] is 'c', B[3] is 'c' → yes. A[3] is 'd', B[2] is 'd' → yes. So return True.What if there are three differing positions? For example, A is \\"abc\\", B is \\"adx\\". diffs length is 3 → return False.So the code handles that.What if two differing positions but swapping them doesn't make it equal? Like A is \\"ab\\", B is \\"cd\\". diffs are 0 and 1. A[0] is a, B[1] is d. So not equal. So returns False.Yes.So the code should handle all these cases.Thus, the function should work correctly.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can swap two characters in string A to make it equal to string B. The solution involves checking specific conditions based on the lengths and contents of the strings. Approach1. Check Lengths: If the lengths of A and B are different, return false immediately as they cannot be made equal by any swap.2. Check Equality: If A and B are already equal, check if there is at least one character that appears more than once. This allows a swap of identical characters which would leave the string unchanged.3. Identify Differences: If A and B are different, find the indices where they differ. If there are exactly two differing indices, check if swapping the characters at these indices in A results in B.

Length Check: The first condition ensures that the two strings can only be compared if they have the same length.2. Equality Check: When A and B are equal, we check for duplicates using a set. If the set of characters in A has fewer elements than the length of A, there are duplicates, making a valid swap possible.3. Difference Indices: If there are exactly two differing indices, we check if swapping the characters at these indices in A results in B. This is done by verifying if the characters at these indices in A match the corresponding characters in B when swapped.This approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the solution is optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the strings."},{"problem":"The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.The operations are described below:\\"../\\" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder.

The problem is to find the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after performing a series of change folder operations given in the logs. Hmm.So the main folder is the starting point. The operations can be moving into a child folder, moving to the parent (but if already in main, stay), or stay in the same folder. After all the operations are done, we need to determine how many steps back (using \\"../\\") are required to get back to the main. And the answer is that number of steps.Wait, right. Because each \\"../\\" moves up one level. So if after all operations, the current depth is D, then the number of operations needed is D, since each \\"../\\" takes you up one level until you hit main.So the problem reduces to calculating the current depth after processing all the logs. Then that depth is the answer. Because you can't do anything else; each \\"../\\" is one step. So regardless of the order, you have to go back D steps.So the plan is: simulate the process of applying all the logs to track the current depth, and then return that depth.How to track the depth:Initialize depth to 0 (main is depth 0).For each log in logs:- If the log is \\"../\\", then subtract 1 from depth, but not less than 0.- If the log is \\"./\\", do nothing.- Else, it's moving into a child folder, so add 1 to depth.So after processing all logs, the current depth is the number of steps needed to return to main.Yes. So the example 1:Logs are [\\"d1/\\",\\"d2/\\",\\"../\\",\\"d21/\\",\\"./\\"]Processing each:d1/ → depth 1d2/ → depth 2../ → depth 1d21/ → depth 2./ → no change → depth 2So answer is 2.

So the algorithm is straightforward.So now, how to code this.In Python, the function will take a list of logs, process each, track the depth, and return the final depth.The steps:Initialize depth = 0.Loop through each log in logs:if log is \\"../\\":   depth = max(0, depth - 1)elif log is \\"./\\":   continueelse:   depth +=1At the end, return depth.Wait, but in the problem statement, the logs[i] is a string like \\"x/\\". So how to check for the operation.Each log is a string. For example, \\"../\\" is the parent operation. \\"./\\" is the current. So for each log in logs:Check if log equals \\"../\\", then apply parent.Else if log equals \\"./\\", no action.Else, it's a move into a child (like \\"d1/\\"), so add 1.Yes.So code:def minOperations(self, logs: List[str]) -> int:    depth = 0    for log in logs:        if log == \\"../\\":            if depth > 0:                depth -=1        elif log == \\"./\\":            continue        else:            depth +=1    return depthWait, but in code, checking for \\"../\\" directly.

Each move to a child folder increases the depth by 1, each move to the parent folder decreases the depth by 1 (but not below 0), and staying in the current folder does not change the depth.2. Key Insight: The number of operations needed to return to the main folder is equivalent to the final depth after processing all log entries.

Let's think about how to approach this.Hmm, the first thing that comes to mind is that the maximum product could be either the product of the three largest numbers or the product of the two smallest (which could be negative) and the largest. Because two negatives multiply to a positive, and then multiplying by a large positive could give a bigger product than just three positives.So, for example, if the array has both negative and positive numbers, the maximum product might come from the two smallest negatives and the largest positive. But if all numbers are positive, then it's just the three largest.So the plan is: sort the array. Then compare the product of the last three (largest) and the product of the first two (smallest, possibly negative) and the last one. The maximum of these two possibilities should be the answer.Wait, right. Because after sorting, the array is in ascending order. So the three largest are at the end. The two smallest could be at the beginning. So the two possible candidates are:1. nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3]2. nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1]We need to take the maximum of these two.But what if the array has more than three elements? Like in example 2, where input is [1,2,3,4]. The three largest are 2,3,4? Wait no, wait sorted is [1,2,3,4], so the three largest are 2,3,4? Wait no, wait in example 2, the product is 2*3*4=24. Which is the correct output. So the approach works there.Another example: what if the array has negative numbers. Like [-5, -4, 1, 2, 3]. The two smallest are -5 and -4. Their product is 20, multiplied by the largest 3 gives 60. The three largest are 1,2,3 product 6. So the maximum is 60. So in this case, the second option is better.So the algorithm is:Sort the array.Compute both possible products (product of three largest and product of two smallest and largest).Return the maximum of these two.But wait, what if there are exactly three elements? Then both options would be the same. So it's covered.Let me test some cases.Test case 1: [1,2,3] sorted. Product of three is 6. Which is correct.Test case 2: [1,2,3,4] sorted. The three largest (2,3,4) product 24. The two smallest (1,2) *4=8. So max is 24. Correct.Another test case: [-5,-4,1,2,3]. The two options are 1*2*3=6 vs (-5)*(-4)*3=60. So max is 60.Another case: [-10, -9, 0, 1, 2]. The two smallest are -10 and -9. Their product is 90 * 2 (largest) is 180. The three largest are 0,1,2 product 0. So the maximum is 180.But wait, what if there are two large negatives but the third is a big positive? Like [-100, -99, 1, 2, 100]. The three largest are 1,2,100 product 200. The two smallest are -100 and -99 multiplied by 100 gives 990000. Which is way bigger. So the maximum is 990000.So the approach works.So the steps are:Sort the array.Compute both possible products.Take the maximum.So in code:Sort the list.n = len(nums)product1 = nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3]product2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1]return max(product1, product2)But wait, what if the array is longer than 3? Like 5 elements. Then those two products are the candidates. But what about other possibilities?Wait, are there any other possible combinations that could yield a higher product?Hmm. Let's think. Suppose the array has more than three elements, but after sorting, perhaps there's a scenario where the maximum product comes from the two smallest and the third largest, but not the first two and the last one.Wait, but after sorting, the two smallest elements are at the beginning. The largest is the last. So product2 is (nums[0] * nums[1] ) * nums[-1]. Are there other combinations?For example, if the array is [-5, -4, -3, 1, 2]. Then the two smallest are -5 and -4. Their product is 20 *2 (largest) is 40. The three largest are -3,1,2 product -6. So the maximum is 40. So product2 is correct.Another example: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]. The three largest are -3, -2, -1. Their product is -6. The two smallest are -5, -4. Their product is 20 * (-1) is -20. So the maximum is -6. But wait, in this case, all numbers are negative. So the maximum product would be the three with the least magnitude (since all are negative, product of three is negative, but choosing the three closest to zero would be the maximum). So sorted array is [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1]. The three largest (by value) are -3, -2, -1. Product is (-3)*(-2)*(-1) = -6. The two smallest are -5 and -4 multiplied by the largest (-1) gives (-5)*(-4)*(-1) = -20. So the maximum is -6. So the code would compute product1 as -3*-2*-1= -6. product2 as (-5)*(-4)*-1= -20. So max(-6, -20) is -6. Which is correct.So in this case, the code works.So the approach seems to handle all cases.So the code steps:Sort the array.Calculate product1 as the product of the three largest numbers (last three elements).Calculate product2 as the product of the two smallest (possibly negative) and the largest.Return the maximum of product1 and product2.But wait, is that all the possibilities?Wait, what if there are four elements, like [-10, 1, 2, 3]. The two smallest are -10 and 1. But their product is -10. Multiply by 3 gives -30. The three largest are 1,2,3 product 6. So the maximum is 6. Which is correct.Another scenario: array like [-10, -9, 2, 3, 4]. Two smallest are -10 and -9. Their product is 90 *4=360. Three largest are 2,3,4 (product 24). So 360 is the maximum.Another edge case: array has three elements. Then product1 and product2 would be the same. So code works.So the code seems to handle all cases.So the code would look like:Sort the array.Compute the two possible products.Return the maximum.So in Python:def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:    nums.sort()    product1 = nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3]    product2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1]    return max(product1, product2)Wait, but what about when the array has more than three elements and there's another possibility where two negatives and one positive not being the last element? Like, for example, if the array is [-100, -99, 50, 60, 100]. Then the two smallest are -100 and -99. The largest is 100. Their product is (-100)*(-99)*100 = 990000. The three largest are 50,60,100: 50*60*100=300000. So the maximum is 990000. So the code returns that, which is correct.But what if the array is [-100, -99, 2, 3, 4]. Then product2 is (-100)*(-99)*4= 39600. The three largest are 2,3,4 (24). So code returns 39600, which is correct.So the code works.But what if there are other combinations of three numbers? Like three negatives? For example, array [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1]. As discussed earlier, the maximum product is (-3)*(-2)*(-1) = -6, which is the correct answer.Another case: [-10, -5, 1, 2, 3]. The two smallest are -10 and -5. Product 50 *3=150. Three largest are 1*2*3=6. So code returns 150.So in all these cases, the code works.So the code seems to handle all possible scenarios. Therefore, the approach is correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum product of three numbers from a given integer array. The solution must efficiently consider both positive and negative numbers to find the optimal product. ApproachThe key insight to solve this problem is recognizing that the maximum product of three numbers can come from one of two possible scenarios:1. The product of the three largest numbers.2. The product of the two smallest numbers (which could be negative) and the largest number. This scenario is important because two negative numbers multiplied by a positive number can yield a large positive product.The steps to implement this approach are as follows:1. Sort the Array: Sorting helps in easily accessing the largest and smallest elements.2. Compute Two Candidate Products:   - The product of the three largest elements (the last three elements in the sorted array).   - The product of the two smallest elements (the first two elements in the sorted array) and the largest element (the last element in the sorted array).3. Return the Maximum: The result is the maximum value between the two computed products. Solution Code\`\`\`pythonfrom typing import Listclass Solution:    def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        nums.sort()        product1 = nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3]        product2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1]        return max(product1, product2)\`\`\` Explanation1. Sorting the Array: By sorting the array, we can easily access the largest elements at the end and the smallest elements at the beginning.2. Calculating Candidate Products:   - Product of Three Largest Elements: This is straightforward as these are the last three elements in the sorted array.   - Product of Two Smallest and Largest Element: This accounts for the scenario where two negative numbers (which become positive when multiplied) combined with the largest positive number might give a higher product.3. Return the Maximum: By comparing the two candidate products, we ensure that we consider both possible maximum values and return the correct result.This approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including arrays with both positive and negative numbers, and ensures an optimal solution with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n)."},{"problem":"Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.A defanged IP address replaces every period \\".\\" with \\"[.]\\". Example 1:Input: address = \\"1.1.1.1\\"Output: \\"1[.]1[.]1[.]1\\"Example 2:Input: address = \\"255.100.50.0\\"Output: \\"255[.]100[.]50[.]0\\" Constraints:The given address is a valid IPv4 address.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to write a Python function called defangIPaddr that takes an IPv4 address string and returns a defanged version where each period is replaced with \\"[.]\\".

So for example, \\"1.1.1.1\\" becomes \\"1[.]1[.]1[.]1\\".How do I do string replacement in Python? Oh right, the string method replace() can be used. Like address.replace('.', '[.]'). But wait, does that replace all occurrences? Because replace() by default replaces all instances of the substring. So that should work.Let me test with the examples. For the first example, \\"1.1.1.1\\" replacing each '.' gives exactly the output. The same for the second example. So using the replace method should work.But wait, maybe there's a case where the input has other characters, but the constraints say the input is a valid IPv4 address. So we don't need to handle invalid inputs. So the function can safely replace all '.' with [.].Therefore, the function can be as simple as returning the address string with all '.' replaced by '[.]'.So the code would be:return address.replace('.', '[.]')That's it? That seems too simple. Let me make sure. Oh right, because in the examples, every '.' is replaced, not just the first occurrence. The replace method in Python replaces all occurrences unless you specify a count. Since we're not specifying a count here, it does all of them. So that's correct.So the entire function is just a single line. Let me check the function definition. The class is Solution, method defangIPaddr takes address as a str and returns a str. So yes, the code should be:class Solution:    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:        return address.replace('.', '[.]')That's the solution. I think that's all there is to it.

Problem Analysis: The task requires transforming each period in an IPv4 address into the string \\"[.]\\". This is a direct string manipulation problem.2. Intuition: Using the \`replace()\` method is efficient here because it processes each character in the string in a single pass, replacing all occurrences of the target substring.3. Algorithm Selection: The \`replace()\` method is chosen due to its simplicity and efficiency for this specific task. It ensures that every instance of \\".\\" is replaced, which meets the problem's requirements perfectly.4. Complexity Analysis: The time complexity of the \`replace()\` method is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Hmm. Let's think.First, what's the key here? Reversing subarrays. Wait, reversing a subarray can be done any number of times. So what's the minimal condition that must be met for arr to be transformed into target?Wait, maybe the order doesn't matter as much as the elements themselves. But wait, no. Because reversing can change the order. Wait, but how? Let's see some examples.In example 1, the target is [1,2,3,4], and arr is [2,4,1,3]. By reversing certain subarrays, they can reach the target. So the elements are the same, just ordered differently.But example 3 shows that even if the arr is reversed (like [12,1] vs [1,12]), it's possible. Because you can reverse the entire array to get the target.So the first thought: the two arrays must have the same elements. Because if arr doesn't have the same elements as target, then it's impossible. Like example 4, where arr doesn't have 9. So checking if the multisets (counts of each element) are the same is a necessary condition.But is that sufficient? Let's see. Suppose the elements are the same. Can we always arrange them into the target order using reverses?Wait, what's the power of reverses here. Any permutation can be achieved by reversing subarrays? Or not?Wait, think of the problem in terms of permutations. Each reverse is a certain permutation. The question is whether the allowed permutations (by any number of reverses) can generate any permutation. If that's true, then as long as the elements are the same, the answer is yes. But I don't think that's the case.Wait, for example, can we generate any permutation? Let's think: with reverses, you can perform any number of adjacent swaps. Wait, no. Because reversing a subarray of length 2 is equivalent to swapping two adjacent elements. But to swap two elements that are not adjacent, you might need multiple reverses.Wait, maybe the reverses allow any permutation. Wait, perhaps not. Let's take a small example. Suppose the array is [1,2,3]. Can I turn it into [3,1,2]?Original: 1,2,3.If I reverse the entire array, get 3,2,1. Then reverse the subarray [2,1], making it 3,1,2. Oh right! So yes. So that permutation is possible.Alternatively, let's think of another permutation. Let's say [2,3,1]. Let's see:Original: 1,2,3.Reverse [1,2,3] → 3,2,1.Then reverse [3,2] → 2,3,1. So yes.Hmm. So maybe, any permutation can be achieved by a series of reverses. Wait, but how?Wait, in the example above, each reverse can be used to move elements into place. For instance, if you can bring elements to the correct position by reversing a subarray that starts or ends at that position.Alternatively, think that since reverses can generate swaps of any two elements. Let's see. Suppose you have elements A, B, C, D. To swap B and D. How?Original: A B C D.Reverse B C D → A D C B.Then reverse C B → A D B C.Reverse D B → A B D C.Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can find a way to swap two elements using a series of reverses. If that's possible, then any permutation can be achieved.But I'm not entirely sure, but let's assume for a moment that if the multisets of elements are the same between target and arr, then it's possible. Then, the solution would be to check if the sorted versions of both arrays are equal.Wait, in example 1, the sorted arrays would be the same, so that's true. Example 3, same elements. Example 4, different elements, so false. Example 5, same elements.But wait, what about a case where the sorted arrays are the same, but the permutation is not possible? Let's think of such a case.Wait, suppose target is [1,3,2], and arr is [2,3,1]. Can we reverse subarrays to get target?Original arr is 2,3,1.If we reverse the entire array → 1,3,2. Which is the target. So yes, possible.Another example: target is [2,1,3], arr is [3,1,2]. Can we do it?Original arr is 3,1,2.Reverse the first two elements: 1,3,2. Then reverse the first two again: 3,1,2. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, maybe reverse [3,1], but that's the same as reversing the first two. Alternatively, reverse the entire array → 2,1,3. Which is the target. Oh right. So yes.So maybe any permutation is possible as long as the elements are the same. Therefore, the answer is simply to check if the two arrays have the same elements (same counts for each element). So the solution is to compare the sorted versions of both arrays.Wait, but how to confirm this? Let's think of a possible case where sorted arrays are same, but you can't reach the target.Wait, let's take a case where the target is [1,2,3,4], and arr is [4,3,2,1]. Then, by reversing the entire array, arr becomes target. So yes.Another case: target is [1,3,2], arr is [2,1,3]. How to reach the target?Original arr: 2,1,3.Reverse the first two elements → 1,2,3. Then reverse the entire array → 3,2,1. Then reverse the last two → 3,1,2. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, maybe another approach.Wait, let's reverse the subarray [1,3] in [2,1,3]. Wait, that's the elements at indices 1 and 2. Reversing them gives 2,3,1. Then reverse the first three elements → 1,3,2. So yes.So it's possible.Hmm. So perhaps, the key is that as long as the elements are the same, any permutation can be achieved. Therefore, the solution is to check if the sorted arrays are the same.If that's the case, then the code is straightforward: sort both arrays and check for equality.But wait, why can't there be a case where the sorted arrays are the same, but you can't reach the target?I can't think of any such example. All the test cases provided in the problem seem to support this idea.For example, example 1: sorted target is [1,2,3,4], sorted arr is [1,2,3,4], so same, returns true.Example 3: sorted arrays are same.Example 5: same elements.The only case where it's false is when the elements are different, like example 4.Therefore, the solution is to check if the two arrays have the same elements (with same frequencies). Which can be done by comparing the sorted versions of both arrays.So the code would be:def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:    return sorted(target) == sorted(arr)But wait, why is this sufficient? Because any permutation can be achieved through reverses. So the answer is yes if and only if the multisets are the same.But why can any permutation be achieved?Well, think of reverses as being able to generate all permutations through a series of swaps. For instance, any permutation can be achieved by a series of adjacent swaps, but reverses can do more than that.Alternatively, think that you can sort the array using reverses. Since you can perform any number of reverses, you can mimic the steps of a sorting algorithm.For example, in bubble sort, you swap adjacent elements. But here, reverses can be used to move elements into place more efficiently.Wait, for example, in selection sort, you find the minimum element and bring it to the front. How to do that with reverses.Suppose the array is [3,2,4,1]. The minimum is 1, which is at index 3. To bring it to the front, you can reverse the subarray from index 0 to 3: reverse [3,2,4,1] → [1,4,2,3]. Now 1 is at the front.Then, find the next minimum (2) in the remaining elements [4,2,3]. It's at index 2. Reverse from index 1 to 2: [4,2] becomes [2,4]. Now array is [1,2,4,3]. Then, reverse the subarray from index 2 to 3: [4,3] becomes [3,4]. So array is [1,2,3,4]. So sorted.Thus, by using reverses, you can sort the array, which suggests that any permutation can be achieved as long as the elements are the same.Therefore, the problem reduces to checking if the multisets (element counts) are the same.Thus, the solution is to check if sorted(arr) equals sorted(target). If yes, return True, else False.So the Python code would be as simple as that.Let me check the examples.Example 1:sorted(target) = [1,2,3,4]sorted(arr) = [1,2,3,4] → True.Example 3:sorted(arr is [1,12] and target is same → True.Example 5: sorted arrays are same → True.Examples 2 and 4 also check out.So the code is correct.Therefore, the function can be written by comparing the sorted lists.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can transform the array \`arr\` into the array \`target\` by reversing any number of non-empty subarrays.

ApproachThe approach is based on the observation that reversing subarrays allows us to permute the elements of \`arr\` in any order.

Because if I can create a date object for the given day, month, and year, then I can find out what day of the week it is.Wait, but how does the datetime module handle dates? Like, if I create a date using datetime.date(year, month, day), then the weekday() method returns 0 for Monday up to 6 for Sunday, or is it different? Or maybe the isoweekday() method which returns 1 for Monday to 7 for Sunday. Oh right, I need to check that.Alternatively, the weekday() function returns Monday as 0 and Sunday as 6? Wait, no. Let me think. Wait, the documentation says that date.weekday() returns 0 for Monday through 6 for Sunday. Wait no, wait. Let me check. Wait, no, the Python documentation says that weekday() returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. Or wait, wait, no, wait, I think I mixed that up. Wait, no. Let's see. According to Python's docs: date.weekday() returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. And date.isoweekday() returns 1 for Monday through 7 for Sunday. So for example, if a date is a Monday, weekday() returns 0 and isoweekday() returns 1.But the problem wants the day names like \\"Sunday\\", \\"Monday\\", etc. So if I get the weekday number, I need to map it to the correct name.Wait, let's see. For example, in example 1: 31 August 2019. Let's check what day that was. The example says the output is Saturday. So according to the problem, that date is a Saturday.So if I create a date object for 2019-08-31 and check weekday(), what would that return? Let's see. Let's think: Let's take a known date. Suppose today is 2023-10-06, which is Friday. date.weekday() would return 4 (since Monday is 0, Tuesday 1, ..., Friday 4). So for Saturday, it's 5, and Sunday is 6.So in the first example, the date is Saturday. So the weekday() function would return 5. So the index in the list of days would need to start with Monday as 0.Wait, so the days order would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So to get the correct name, if the weekday() gives 0 (Monday), the list should be ordered as [\\"Monday\\", \\"Tuesday\\", ..., \\"Sunday\\"]. Wait, no. Wait, the index for the weekday() result is 0 for Monday, 1 Tuesday, etc., up to 6 for Sunday. So the list of day names in order would be [\\"Monday\\", \\"Tuesday\\", \\"Wednesday\\", \\"Thursday\\", \\"Friday\\", \\"Saturday\\", \\"Sunday\\"].So for example, if the date's weekday() returns 5, that's Saturday, which is index 5 in the list, which is correct. So then, the function would look up that list and return the correct day.So the plan is:1. Use the datetime module to create a date object for the given year, month, day.2. Get the weekday() of that date, which gives 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday).3. Create a list of day names in the correct order, starting with Monday as index 0, up to Sunday as index 6.Wait, but the problem expects the output to be one of the values in {\\"Sunday\\", \\"Monday\\", \\"Tuesday\\", \\"Wednesday\\", \\"Thursday\\", \\"Friday\\", \\"Saturday\\"}.Wait, the sample outputs show that for example 1, the output is Saturday, which is the sixth day in the list starting from Monday. So if the list is ordered [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday], then the index for Saturday is 5. Because 0:Monday, 1:Tuesday, 2:Wednesday, 3:Thursday,4:Friday,5:Saturday,6:Sunday.So yes, that's correct.Wait, but what if the date is a Sunday. Then the weekday() returns 6, which would index into the list and get Sunday. That's correct.So the list should be in the order: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.But the problem's sample 1 expects Saturday, which is index 5.Wait, let's check that sample. The date is 31 August 2019. Let's see, 2019-08-31. Let me check what day that was. Oh right, August 31, 2019 was indeed a Saturday. So the code using the datetime module would correctly return that.So the steps for the function would be:- Import the datetime module (but in Python, it's from datetime import date? Or maybe use the date class from the datetime module.)Wait, in Python, to create a date object, you can do:import datetimed = datetime.date(year, month, day)Then, d.weekday() gives the day of the week as 0=Monday to 6=Sunday.So, for the given date, create the date object, get the weekday() number, then index into the list.So the list would be:days = [\\"Monday\\", \\"Tuesday\\", \\"Wednesday\\", \\"Thursday\\", \\"Friday\\", \\"Saturday\\", \\"Sunday\\"]Then, return days[weekday_number].Wait, but the sample input 2 is 18 July 1999, which is output Sunday. Let's see. Let's check that date.July 18, 1999. What day was that?Wait, perhaps I should check online. But according to the sample, the output is Sunday. So according to the code, when we create the date object, the weekday() would return 6 (Sunday), because the list's index 6 is Sunday. Wait, no. Wait, if the day is Sunday, then the weekday() returns 6, which is the index of Sunday in the list. So the code would return \\"Sunday\\", which matches the sample.Wait, but sample 2's output is Sunday, which is correct. So according to the code, if the date is Sunday, the code would return days[6], which is Sunday. So that's correct.But wait, let's take sample 2: day=18, month=7 (July), year=1999. Let's see:July 18, 1999. What was the day? According to the sample, it's Sunday.So the code would create the date object for 1999-07-18. The weekday() of that date is 6 (Sunday), so days[6] is Sunday, which is correct.So the code seems correct.Another sample: 15 August 1993. Output is Sunday. Let's check that. August 15, 1993. According to the code, when we create the date, its weekday() is 6 (Sunday), which would return days[6] as Sunday. Correct.So the approach is valid.So the steps for the code are:1. Create a list of days in order from Monday to Sunday.2. Use the date's weekday() method to get the index.3. Return the corresponding day name.So the code would look like:from datetime import dateclass Solution:    def dayOfTheWeek(self, day: int, month: int, year: int) -> str:        d = date(year, month, day)        days = [\\"Monday\\", \\"Tuesday\\", \\"Wednesday\\", \\"Thursday\\", \\"Friday\\", \\"Saturday\\", \\"Sunday\\"]        return days[d.weekday()]Wait, but wait. Let me test the first sample again. For 31 August 2019 (2019-8-31), date.weekday() returns 5, which is Saturday. So days[5] is \\"Saturday\\". Which matches the sample.Yes. So this code should work.But the problem says that the dates are between 1971 and 2100. Does Python's date module handle those years? Because in some systems, the date module may have limitations, but Python's datetime module can handle a wide range. For example, years 1 to 9999. So 1971-2100 should be okay.Therefore, this code should work for all cases in the problem's constraints.Another way is to compute the day manually using Zeller's Congruence or another algorithm. But using the built-in module is easier and less error-prone.So this should be the solution.But wait, are there any possible issues with the code? Like, leading zeros in month or day? But the function parameters are given as integers, so for example, month 8 is August, which is correct. So the code is okay.So the function is as written.

So for three consecutive elements, the starting index can be up to n-3. For example, if the array has 5 elements, indices 0-4. The triplets would be 0-1-2, 1-2-3, 2-3-4. So starting indices 0,1,2. So for n elements, the loop runs from i=0 to i = len(arr)-3. Wait, no. Because for i in range(len(arr) - 2): Because when i is len(arr)-3, i+2 is len(arr)-1. So yeah, the loop should run from i=0 to i= len(arr)-3 inclusive. So in Python, for i in range(len(arr) - 2):Then, for each i, check if arr[i], arr[i+1], arr[i+2] are all odd.If any such triplet is found, return True immediately. If after checking all possible triplets none are found, return False.But wait, what if the array has less than 3 elements? Then, there can't be three consecutive odds. So in that case, return False. So first, handle the edge case where the array's length is less than 3. So in the code, maybe start by checking if len(arr) < 3, return False.So the steps are:1. Check if the length of arr is less than 3. If yes, return False.2. Otherwise, iterate through the array from index 0 to len(arr)-3 (inclusive). For each i, check if arr[i], arr[i+1], arr[i+2] are all odd.3. If any triplet is found, return True.4. If after checking all triplets none are found, return False.So how do I check if a number is odd? Using modulo 2. So a number % 2 == 1 implies it's odd.But wait, what if the number is 0? But according to the constraints, arr[i] is at least 1. So no problem.So in code:for i in range(len(arr) - 2):    if arr[i] % 2 == 1 and arr[i+1] % 2 ==1 and arr[i+2] % 2 ==1:        return Truereturn FalseBut wait, let's think about the edge cases.Example 1: arr = [2,6,4,1]. The array's length is 4. So len(arr)-2 is 2. So i runs 0,1,2? Wait, no. len(arr) is 4. len(arr)-3 is 1. So in a loop from 0 to len(arr)-3. Wait, wait, the code I wrote was using len(arr) - 2 as the upper limit for i. Wait, in Python, the range is up to but not including the end. So if len(arr) is 4, len(arr)-2 is 2. So range(4-2) is range(2) which is 0 and 1. But we need i to go up to 2 in that case. Wait, wait. Wait, let's see.Wait, the possible triplets for an array of length 4 (indices 0,1,2,3) are 0-1-2 and 1-2-3. So the starting indices are 0 and 1. So the loop should run for i in 0 and 1. So the number of iterations is len(arr) - 2. Because for each i, the triplet is i, i+1, i+2. So the maximum i is len(arr) -3. Because len(arr) -3 + 2 = len(arr)-1, which is the last index.So the loop should run for i in range(len(arr)-2). For example, len(arr)=4. len(arr)-2=2. So i=0,1. Which is correct.So in code:if len(arr) <3:    return Falsefor i in range(len(arr)-2):    if arr[i]%2 !=0 and arr[i+1]%2 !=0 and arr[i+2]%2 !=0:        return Truereturn FalseYes, that seems correct.Testing example 2: [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]. The length is 9, so len(arr)-2 is 7. So i runs from 0 to 6 (inclusive). Let's see where the triplet is. The triplet 5,7,23 starts at index 5. So i=5. Checking arr[5] is 5, which is odd. arr[6] is 7 (odd), arr[7] is 23 (odd). So that triplet is found, so return True.Another test case: arr = [3,5,7]. Then i=0. All three are odd. So returns True.Another test case: arr = [3,5,6,7]. Then i runs from 0 to 1. For i=0: 3,5,6: 6 is even. So no. For i=1:5,6,7: 5 is odd, 6 even. So returns False.So the code should handle these cases.So the code is correct.Now, the function needs to be written as part of a class Solution. The function is called threeConsecutiveOdds, takes arr: List[int], returns bool.So the code would be:from typing import Listclass Solution:    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:        if len(arr) < 3:            return False        for i in range(len(arr) - 2):            if arr[i] % 2 == 1 and arr[i+1] % 2 ==1 and arr[i+2] % 2 ==1:                return True        return FalseWait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns 0 or 1 for even and odd numbers, respectively. So checking if arr[i] % 2 ==1 is correct.Yes.So this should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if there are three consecutive odd numbers in a given integer array.

Let's think about how to approach this.First, the problem says the words are sorted lexicographically based on the given order. So, each word should come before the next one according to the alien order. If any word is out of order, we return false.Hmm, so what's lexicographical order here? Like, in English, \\"apple\\" comes before \\"banana\\" because 'a' is before 'b'. But if the alien order has a different sequence, like 'b' comes before 'a', then the opposite could be true.So the steps I need to take are:1. Compare each pair of consecutive words in the list.2. For each pair, check if the first word is lexicographically less than or equal to the second word according to the alien order.3. If all pairs are valid, return true; otherwise, false.But how do I compare two words based on the alien order?Let's think. For each character in the two words, compare the characters at the same position. The first position where they differ determines the order. If all compared characters are the same, then the shorter word comes first.So, for example, if the words are \\"hello\\" and \\"leetcode\\", we compare each character:h vs l. According to the order given in example 1, h comes before l, so \\"hello\\" is before \\"leetcode\\" — correct.In example 3, \\"apple\\" vs \\"app\\": the first three characters are same. But \\"apple\\" is longer, so \\"app\\" should come first. But in the example, the output is false because \\"apple\\" is longer, which makes it larger. So according to the problem's lex rules, if one word is a prefix of the other, the shorter one comes first. So \\"app\\" is shorter than \\"apple\\", so \\"app\\" should come before \\"apple\\". But in example 3, the input words are [\\"apple\\",\\"app\\"], so the order is invalid, hence the output is false.So, the key points are:- For each pair of words, compare character by character.- Find the first differing character. Compare their positions in the alien order. If the first's position is higher than the second's, the order is invalid.- If all characters are same up to the length of the shorter word, then check if the first word is longer than the second. If yes, then invalid (since shorter should come first).So, the plan is:Loop through each consecutive pair of words (i from 0 to len(words)-2, compare words[i] and words[i+1]).For each pair:- Compare each character in order until a mismatch is found.- If a mismatch is found, check the order. If the first's order is higher than the second's, return false.- If no mismatch and the first word is longer than the second, return false.If all pairs pass, return true.Now, to implement this, I need a way to quickly look up the order of a character. So, create a dictionary that maps each character to its index in the order string. For example, order = \\"hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\\", then the dictionary would have 'h' -> 0, 'l' -> 1, 'a' -> 2, etc. This allows O(1) lookups for each character's priority.So first, create the order dictionary. Then, for each pair of words, perform the checks.Let's outline the code steps:1. Create a dictionary for order mapping: char_to_index.2. Iterate through each consecutive pair of words.3. For each pair (word1, word2):   a. Compare each character up to the minimum length of the two.   b. For each position j:      i. If word1[j] != word2[j]:         - Check their indices in char_to_index.         - If word1's char index > word2's, return false.         - Else, break the loop for this pair, since the order is determined.   c. If all compared characters are the same and len(word1) > len(word2):      - return false.4. If all pairs are checked and no issues, return true.Now, let's think about edge cases.Case where one word is a prefix of the other. Like \\"app\\" and \\"apple\\". Then, since \\"app\\" is shorter, it should come first. So, if words are [\\"apple\\", \\"app\\"], then the second is shorter but comes after the first, which is invalid. So in this case, we return false.Another edge case: words with same characters but varying lengths. Like [\\"a\\", \\"aa\\"]. Then \\"a\\" comes before \\"aa\\" since it's shorter. So if the input is [\\"aa\\", \\"a\\"], then it's invalid.Another case: words where the first differing character is in the middle. Like \\"hello\\" and \\"hella\\". The first three characters are same. The fourth character 'l' vs 'l' same. Then fifth 'o' vs 'a'. Check their positions.Now, code structure.In Python:class Solution:    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:        # Create the order mapping        char_order = {c:i for i, c in enumerate(order)}                # Iterate through each consecutive pair        for i in range(len(words)-1):            word1 = words[i]            word2 = words[i+1]                        # Compare each character in the words            for j in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))):                c1 = word1[j]                c2 = word2[j]                if c1 != c2:                    # Compare their order                    if char_order[c1] > char_order[c2]:                        return False                    # else, the order is correct for this pair, break and check next pair                    break            else:                # All characters were same up to min length                # Check if word1 is longer than word2                if len(word1) > len(word2):                    return False        # All pairs are valid        return TrueWait, the else clause here is attached to the for loop. So if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., all characters up to min length are same), then execute the else block.In that case, if the lengths are different and word1 is longer, return false.Yes. So this should handle the case where one is a prefix of the other.Testing example 3:Input: [\\"apple\\",\\"app\\"], order is normal.The code compares each character up to 3 (since \\"app\\" is length 3, \\"apple\\" is 5). All first three are same. Then, in the else clause, check len(word1)=5 > len(word2)=3: yes. So return false. Which is correct.In example 2: [\\"word\\",\\"world\\",\\"row\\"], the order is given. Let's see the first pair: \\"word\\" vs \\"world\\". Compare each character:w vs w: same.o vs o: same.r vs r: same.d vs l: compare in order. The order given in example 2 is \\"worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz\\". So 'd' comes after 'l'? Let's see the order string: \\"worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz\\".Wait, the order in example 2 is \\"worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz\\". So the first characters are 'w','o','r','l','d', etc. So 'w' is index 0, 'o' 1, 'r' 2, 'l'3, 'd'4, then a,b,c, etc.So in the first pair, \\"word\\" and \\"world\\". The fourth character is d (from \\"word\\") and l (from \\"world\\"). So comparing d (index4) and l (index3). Oh wait, the order is 'w','o','r','l','d'. So 'l' is at index3, 'd' is index4. So when comparing, word1's d (index4) is greater than word2's l (index3). So 4>3, which means word1 is larger than word2. Hence, the first pair is invalid. So the code would return false here, as per example 2. But the example's output is false because words[0] > words[1], which is exactly this case.So the code seems to handle this.What about if the order is the normal English order and words are [\\"apple\\", \\"app\\"]? Then, the code checks the first 3 characters, which are same. Then, since len(word1) is 5 > 3, returns false. Which is correct.Another test case: words in order. Like [\\"hello\\", \\"leetcode\\"], order as example 1. The code compares h vs l. The order for h is 0, l is 1. So 0 <1, so correct. So returns true.So the code should handle all these cases.What about a case where two words have different lengths, but after the min length, the first is shorter. Like [\\"app\\", \\"apple\\"], order is normal. Then, code checks first 3 letters, same. Then since len(word1)=3 <5, so no problem. So returns true.Another case: [\\"a\\", \\"b\\"], order is \\"ba...\\". So 'b' comes first. Then, a comes after. So comparing a and b in this order: a has higher index. So 'a' is in order after 'b'. So [\\"a\\", \\"b\\"] would be invalid. The code would compare a and b. Since order['a'] is higher than order['b']? Wait, the order is \\"ba...\\", so the index for 'b' is 0, 'a' is 1. So 'a' has index1, 'b' index0. So code would check a's index (1) > b's index (0) → which would return false, correct.So the code seems to handle all cases.Potential edge cases:- All words are identical. Like [\\"abc\\", \\"abc\\"]. Then, the code would check each character, same, then check lengths. Same. So return true.- Words with varying lengths but same prefixes. Like [\\"a\\", \\"ab\\", \\"abc\\"], which should be valid. The code would compare each consecutive pair:a vs ab: compare first character (same), then len(a) is 1 <2 → valid.ab vs abc: first two same, len(ab) < len(abc) → valid. So returns true.So code works.Another case: [\\"abcd\\", \\"ab\\"] → invalid. The code compares first two characters, same, but the first word is longer → returns false.So yes, the code should handle that.Therefore, this approach should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a list of words is sorted lexicographically according to a given alien alphabet order.

And X has to be at least 2. Hmm. Let's think through this step by step.First, I remember that the examples show that the counts of each number matter. Like in the first example, each number appears exactly two times, so X can be 2. But in the second example, the counts are 3,3,2. Wait, no. Let me check. Oh right, the input is [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]. So counts are 3 (for 1), 3 (for 2), 2 (for 3). So the possible X here would need to divide all those counts. The GCD of 3,3,2 is 1. But X must be >=2, so that's why it returns false.So the key here is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the counts of the numbers. If that GCD is >=2, then return true. Otherwise, false. Oh right! Because the GCD is the largest X that divides all counts. So if it's at least 2, then yes. Otherwise, no.So the plan is:1. Count the frequency of each number in the deck.2. Compute the GCD of all these frequencies.3. Check if the GCD is >=2.But how to compute the GCD of a list of numbers? Let's think. The GCD of a list is the GCD of all pairs. So we can compute the GCD iteratively. Like take the first two numbers, compute their GCD, then compute the GCD of that result with the next number, and so on.For example, counts are [3,3,2], then GCD(3,3) is 3, then GCD(3,2) is 1. So overall GCD is 1.Another example: counts [2,2,4]. GCD(2,2) is 2, then GCD(2,4) is 2. So GCD is 2, which is >=2, so return true.So the steps for code would be:- Use a counter to get frequencies. In Python, we can use collections.Counter for this.- Get the values (the frequencies) from the counter.- Compute the GCD of these values. If the GCD is >=2, return True, else False.But wait, what if there's only one element? Like example 3: input [1]. The count is 1. So GCD is 1, which is less than 2. So return false. That's covered.Edge Cases:- If all numbers are the same and the count is >=2. Like [1,1], returns true. Because GCD of [2] is 2.Wait, but if there's only one frequency (like all elements same), then the GCD is that frequency. So as long as it's >=2, it's okay.So, in code:First, get the counts. Then compute their GCD.But how to compute the GCD of a list of numbers. Let's see. For example, if the counts are [6, 4, 8], the GCD is 2. How?We can start with the first count as the current_gcd. Then for each next count in the list, compute the GCD of current_gcd and the next count, and update current_gcd. If at any point current_gcd becomes 1, we can break early, since GCD can't get lower than 1.So for the code:Compute the GCD of all counts.Now, how to handle the case where there's only one count. Like if all elements are same. For example, [1,1], counts is [2], then the GCD is 2. So return true.Another case: [1,1,1], counts [3]. GCD is 3. But X needs to be >=2. So in this case, since 3 >=2, the function should return true. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the deck must be split into 1 or more groups. Each group must have exactly X cards, same integer. So if there is one group, like X=3 here, then yes, it's possible. Because the group would have exactly 3 cards, all same. So yes.So the code would return True for [1,1,1], since the GCD is 3, which is >=2. But wait, in that case, X would be 3. Then the group has exactly 3 cards, all same. So yes.So the code would correctly handle that.So steps:1. Count the occurrences of each number in the deck.2. Collect those counts into a list.3. Compute the GCD of all counts.4. Return True if the GCD is >=2; else False.Now, the next step is to code this.In Python:Import Counter from collections.Then, in the function:def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:First, count the elements.counts = list(Counter(deck).values())Then compute the GCD.But how to compute GCD in Python? The math.gcd function, but that's for two numbers. For a list, we need to compute iteratively.Also, note that in Python, math.gcd returns the GCD of two numbers, and the function only takes two arguments. So, for the list of counts, we can compute the GCD by iteratively applying gcd.But also, we need to handle the case where the counts list is empty? Well, deck has at least 1 element (since constraint is 1 <= deck.length), so counts list is at least length 1.Wait, but if all elements are unique. Like deck is [1,2,3], then counts are [1,1,1]. The GCD is 1, which is less than 2. So returns false. Correct.So in code:from collections import Counterimport mathThen, in the function:counts = list(Counter(deck).values())if len(counts) == 0:    return False  # but deck is non-empty, so counts can't be empty. So maybe this is redundant.current_gcd = counts[0]for num in counts[1:]:    current_gcd = math.gcd(current_gcd, num)    if current_gcd == 1:        break  # since GCD can't get lower than 1return current_gcd >= 2Wait, but what if the counts list has only one element, like [n]. Then current_gcd is n. So return whether n >=2.Yes. For example, [1,1] gives counts [2], current_gcd is 2. So return true.Another example: [1], counts [1], current_gcd is 1. So return false.Yes.So this code should handle all cases.But wait, what if the initial current_gcd is 0? But according to the constraints, deck[i] is >=0. Wait, for example, if the deck is [0,0], counts [2], which is okay. But if deck has a 0, like [0,0,0,0], counts [4], which would have current_gcd 4 >=2, returns true.But math.gcd(0,0) would be 0, but in our problem, counts can't be zero. Because each element in counts is the count of a number in the deck, and the deck has at least one element. So counts can't have zero. So the initial current_gcd is the first count, which is at least 1.Wait, for example, if the deck is [5], counts is [1], current_gcd is 1. So returns false.So the code seems to handle that.Let's test the examples:Example 1: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]Counts are 2 for each number. So counts [2,2,2,2]. GCD is 2. So returns True.Example 2: [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]. counts [3,3,2]. GCD is 1. So returns false.Example 3: [1], counts [1], returns false.Example4: [1,1], counts [2], returns true.Example5: [1,1,2,2,2,2]. counts are 2 (for 1) and 4 (for 2). GCD of 2 and4 is 2. So returns true.Yes. All examples would pass.Another test case: [1,1,1]. counts [3]. GCD is 3 >=2. So returns true.Another test case: [1,2]. counts [1,1]. GCD is 1. So returns false.Another test case: [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3]. counts are 2,2,4. GCD(2,2) is 2, then GCD(2,4) is 2. So returns true.So the code should work.Potential edge cases:- All counts are the same. Like [2,2,2,3,3,3]. Then GCD is 3, returns true.- Mix of even and odd counts. Like counts [4,6,8,10], GCD is 2. So returns true.So the code should handle all these.Thus, the code should be correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a deck of cards can be split into groups such that each group has exactly X cards, all with the same integer, where X is at least 2. The solution involves checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the counts of each integer in the deck. If the GCD of these counts is at least 2, then it is possible to form such groups. Approach1. Count Frequencies: First, we count the frequency of each integer in the deck using a counter.2. Compute GCD: We then compute the GCD of all these frequencies. The GCD of the frequencies will tell us the largest possible group size X that can divide all the counts.3. Check Condition: If the GCD is at least 2, return true; otherwise, return false.

The power is the longest substring with the same character. Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.So, the input is a string, and I have to check all possible consecutive characters. For example, in \\"leetcode\\", the 'ee' is the longest, so output is 2. Right.First, maybe I should iterate through the string and keep track of the current run length. Like, compare each character with the previous one. If it's the same, increment the current count. If not, reset the count. And keep updating the maximum value as I go.Wait, that sounds right. Let's outline the steps:Initialize max_count and current_count to 1. Wait, wait. Wait, the string is at least length 1. So for a string like \\"a\\", the output is 1. So initial max and current can be 1. Then, starting from the second character.So for each index i from 1 to len(s)-1:- if s[i] == s[i-1], then current_count +=1- else, reset current_count to 1- after each step, check if current_count is greater than max_count, and update max_count if so.Yes, that makes sense. Because for each position, we compare with the previous character. If they are the same, the current streak increases. Otherwise, it starts a new streak. And we track the maximum streak encountered.Let me test this logic with the examples.Take example 2: \\"abbcccddddeeeeedcba\\"The substrings are a (1), bb (2), ccc (3), dddd (4), eeeee (5), then others. So during iteration, when the e's are processed, the current count would go up to 5, which would be the max.Another example: \\"hooraaaaaaaaaaay\\". The 'o' in 'hoo' is two, then the 'r' is 1, then the a's. Let's see: h (1), oo (so current becomes 2, max is 2), r (reset to 1), then a's start. The a's are a lot. So current would increment each time. The max would eventually be 11. So the code should capture that.Edge cases: a single character, returns 1. All characters same: like \\"aaaaa\\" returns 5. Or something like \\"ab\\", returns 1 since each has only 1.So the steps for the code:Initialize max_power and current_power as 1. Because even for the first character, the initial run is 1.Then loop from i=1 to len(s)-1:Check if current character is same as previous. If yes, current_power +=1. Then compare to max_power. If no, reset current_power to 1.Wait, but after incrementing, we need to check if it's larger than max. So the order is:For each i starting at 1:if s[i] == s[i-1], current +=1. Then max_power = max(max_power, current). Else, current = 1. Wait, but after resetting, maybe the max was already higher, so no need to check. Because when you reset to 1, the max could be higher.Wait, for example, if the current was 5 (max is 5), then you hit a different character. So current becomes 1. The max remains 5. So after each increment of current, we need to check and update max. Because otherwise, if the entire string is a run of same characters, then we need to update the max after each step.Yes. So the steps in code would be:Initialize max_power = 1, current =1.Loop i from 1 to len(s)-1:if s[i] == s[i-1]:    current +=1    if current > max_power:        max_power = currentelse:    current = 1Wait, but what if the current is incremented but not checked? Like, when you have a longer run than before. For example, after incrementing current, you have to check if it's the new maximum.Alternatively, after every increment, compare to max_power and update. So that way, even if current is larger, the max is updated.So code:for i in range(1, len(s)):    if s[i] == s[i-1]:        current +=1        max_power = max(max_power, current)    else:        current =1Wait, but what if the current run is longer than any previous, but the next character breaks it. For example, 'aaaab'. The code would check each time. Let's see:i=1: s[1] == a. current=2, max becomes 2.i=2: current=3, max 3.i=3: current=4, max 4.i=4: 'b' not equal to a. current reset to 1. So max remains 4. Which is correct.Yes, this approach works.So the code structure is:def maxPower(s: str) -> int:    if len(s) ==0:        return 0  # but according to constraints, s is at least 1.    max_power = 1    current =1    for i in range(1, len(s)):        if s[i] == s[i-1]:            current +=1            if current > max_power:                max_power = current        else:            current =1    return max_powerWait, but the code can handle all cases. Let's test example 5: 'tourist' which outputs 1. Each character is different. So in each step, current is 1, then reset. So the max remains 1. Correct.Another example: 'a' returns 1.Another example: 'aaabbb', the code would track a run of 3 a's (current=3, max=3), then the b's. When the first b comes, current resets to 1, then increments to 2, then 3. So the max would be 3. But the code's code would update max_power when current increases. So for the a's, it's 3. Then for the b's, current becomes 3, which would be equal to max, so max remains 3. So code returns 3. Which is correct.Yes. So this code should work.So the Python function would be written as such.Now, considering edge cases. What if the string is all same characters, like 'zzzzz'. Then, the loop runs 4 times (since len is 5, indexes 1 to 4). Each time, current increases and max is updated. So the final max is 5. Correct.What about the example 4: \\"hooraaaaaaaaaaay\\". Let's see. Let's walk through the code.The string starts with 'h', then 'o' (i=1). So first, 'h' and 'o' are different. So current resets to 1. Then i=2 is 'o' again. 'o' == previous 'o' (i=2 is index 2, s[1] is 'o'). So current becomes 2. Max becomes 2.Then i=3: 'r' is different from 'o'. current reset to 1.Then i=4: 'a' (since the string starts with h, o, o, r, then a long a's). So when i=4, s[4] is 'a', s[3] is 'r' -> different. current is 1.From i=4 onwards, the a's start. For each subsequent a, current increments and max is updated each time. Let's say there are 11 a's. So the loop will run through each a, and current increases from 1 to 11. Each increment triggers an update to max. So after the first a (i=4), current is 1, then i=5 (next a) current is 2, max becomes 2. Then i=6: current 3, max 3. ... up to 11. So the final max is 11.Yes, that's correct.So the code works for all these cases.Therefore, the code should be as written.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum power of a given string, which is defined as the length of the longest non-empty substring consisting of a single unique character.  ApproachThe approach involves iterating through the string while keeping track of the current consecutive character streak and updating the maximum streak encountered. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:1. Initialization: Start with two variables, \`max_power\` and \`current\`, both set to 1. This handles the base case where the string has at least one character.2. Iteration: Loop through the string starting from the second character. For each character:   - If it matches the previous character, increment the \`current\` streak.   - If it does not match, reset the \`current\` streak to 1.   - After each increment, update \`max_power\` if the \`current\` streak exceeds the previous maximum.3.

If they are the same, the current streak length (\`current\`) is incremented. If not, the streak is reset to 1.- Update Maximum: After each increment of the current streak, it is checked against the maximum streak length found so far (\`max_power\`). If it is longer, \`max_power\` is updated.This approach efficiently processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This ensures optimal performance even for the maximum constraint of 500 characters."},{"problem":"Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them.

Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called reverseStr that takes a string s and an integer k, and returns the modified string according to the problem's rules. The rule is to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters in the string. Hmm.So, the example given is s = \\"abcdefg\\" and k=2. The output is \\"bacdfeg\\". Let's break that down. The string length is 7. The first 2k is 4 characters, right? So first 4 characters are \\"abcd\\". Wait, but for each 2k chunk, reverse the first k. So for the first 4 characters (which is 2k=4), reverse the first 2. So ab becomes ba. Then the next 2k is positions 4-8, but the string is only 7 characters. So next 4 would start at index 4 (if we start counting from 0?), maybe? Let me think again.The original example: the string is abcdefg (indices 0-6). For every 2k characters, reverse first k. So k=2, so 2k=4. So the first chunk is 0-3 (4 characters). Reverse the first 2: indices 0 and 1. So ab becomes ba. The substring becomes \\"bacd\\". Then the next chunk starts at 4, which is the next 4 characters. But the remaining characters are efg (positions 4-6). So in this next 2k chunk (which is 4 characters), but only 3 left. So reverse first k=2 characters. The characters are e and f. So reverse them to fe. So the substring becomes feg. So putting it all together: bacd + feg → bacdfeg. Which matches the example.So the approach is to split the string into chunks of 2k characters. For each chunk, reverse the first k characters. If a chunk has less than k characters left, reverse all. If between k and 2k-1, reverse the first k and leave the rest.So, how to process the string in steps of 2k? Let's think in terms of loops. For i in 0 to len(s) step 2k. For each i, take the substring starting at i, of length 2k. Then process that substring by reversing the first k characters.Wait, but each chunk is 2k long. So for each i starting at 0, 2k, 4k, etc., we look at the substring s[i:i+2k]. For each such substring, reverse the first k characters. But if the substring is shorter than k, reverse all. If it's between k and 2k-1, reverse first k.Wait, maybe that's the way. So for each chunk of 2k length (processed as every 2k steps), take the first k characters of that chunk, reverse them, then leave the rest as is.So the steps would be:1. Split the string into chunks of size 2k each.2. For each chunk, reverse the first k characters. If the chunk is smaller than k, reverse all. If between k and 2k, reverse first k.But how to handle each chunk? Let's think in terms of the original string. For each position i (starting at 0, 2k, 4k, ...), take the substring s[i:i+2k]. Then, within that substring, reverse the first k characters.But the original string may not be a multiple of 2k. So, for each i in steps of 2k:- The current chunk is s[i:i+2k]- For that chunk, take the first part (first k characters) and reverse them.- The second part (k to 2k-1) remains as is.But if the chunk's length is less than k, reverse the entire chunk. If it's between k and 2k-1, reverse first k (as per the problem statement).So, how to handle each chunk?For each i:- Get the substring from i to i+2k (exclusive). Let's call this part.- Take the first min(k, len(part)) characters of part, reverse them, then append the remaining characters (from k onwards) as is.Wait, but the problem says: for every 2k characters, reverse the first k. If less than k left in the current 2k chunk, reverse all. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.Wait the problem statement says:\\"For every 2k characters counting from the start of the string, reverse the first k characters. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, reverse the first k and leave the others as original.\\"Ah, right. So the 2k is the window in which we reverse the first k. So for each group of 2k characters (starting from the start), we reverse the first k. So for the first 2k characters, reverse first k, next 2k, reverse first k, etc.But when the remaining characters are less than 2k, but >=k, reverse first k. If remaining <k, reverse all.Wait, perhaps the process is to process the string in steps of 2k. For each step, handle the next 2k characters. But how?Another approach: iterate through the string in steps of 2k. For each step i (starting at 0, 2k, 4k, ...), take the substring s[i:i+2k], then reverse the first k characters of this substring. Then, in the final string, replace this substring with the modified one.But how to handle when the substring's length is less than k or between k and 2k?Wait, the problem says:- For every 2k characters (from the start), reverse first k.But the condition for when there are less than k left applies to each such 2k chunk. Wait no, perhaps the 2k is the step. So for each i in 0, 2k, 4k, etc., we look at the substring starting at i. Then, in that substring, reverse the first k characters if possible. So the chunk is the next 2k characters, but if there are less than 2k, then the chunk is whatever remains.But the problem says:For each 2k characters counting from the start, reverse first k. So, the groups are every 2k characters starting at 0. So group 0-2k-1, then 2k-4k-1, etc. For each of these groups, reverse the first k characters.But within each group, regardless of the group's length. Wait, no. Because if the group is shorter than k, then reverse all. If between k and 2k, reverse first k. So, for each group (i to i+2k), process the first k characters of that group (if possible), then proceed.So the algorithm would be:Loop over the string in increments of 2k. For each position i (starting at 0, 2k, 4k, etc.), take the substring s[i:i+2k]. Then, for this substring:- If the length of this substring is less than k: reverse all of it.- Else: reverse the first k characters, leave the rest as is.Then, concatenate all these processed substrings to form the result.Yes, that seems right.So the steps are:Initialize the result as an empty string.Loop i from 0 to len(s) with step 2k.For each i:- Take the substring from i to i+2k (exclusive). Let's call this chunk.- If len(chunk) <k: reverse chunk.- Else: reverse the first k characters, append the rest as is.- Append this processed chunk to the result.So, for example, in the sample input:s = \\"abcdefg\\", k=2.i=0: chunk is \\"abcd\\" (since 0+4=4, but len(s)=7). So len(chunk)=4 >=k=2. Reverse first 2: \\"ab\\" becomes \\"ba\\". So chunk becomes \\"ba\\" + \\"cd\\" → \\"bacd\\". Append to result.i=4: next chunk is s[4:4+4] → \\"efg\\". len is 3. Since 3 >=k=2 (wait 3 is >=2?), but wait according to the problem statement, if in the 2k chunk (which for this chunk is 4, but the chunk is 3 characters), then if the remaining is between k and 2k (which here, 3 is >=k=2 and less than 2k=4?), then reverse first k (2) characters. So in this chunk \\"efg\\", the first 2 characters are 'e' and 'f', reversed to 'fe'. Then append the remaining 'g'. So the processed chunk is 'feg'.So overall, the result is 'bacd' + 'feg' → 'bacdfeg' which matches the example.So the algorithm seems correct.Now, how to implement this in Python.First, the steps in code:Initialize the result as a list (since strings are immutable, using a list for efficiency).Loop i in 0 to len(s) with step 2k:    chunk = s[i:i+2k]    # process the chunk    first_part = chunk[0:k]    reversed_first = first_part[::-1]    if len(chunk) <=k:        processed_chunk = reversed_first    else:        processed_chunk = reversed_first + chunk[k:]    # append processed chunk to the result listThen, after processing all chunks, join the list into a string and return.Wait, but chunk may be longer than 2k? No, because we take s[i:i+2k], which is up to 2k characters. So in each iteration, the chunk is at most 2k in length.But for each chunk, regardless of its length (could be up to 2k), reverse first k characters if possible.So, code steps:For each i in range(0, len(s), 2*k):    current_chunk = s[i:i+2*k]    # process current_chunk    # split into first k and the rest    first_part = current_chunk[:k]    reversed_first = first_part[::-1]    # the remaining part is current_chunk[k:]    # if current_chunk has length less than k, then reversed_first is the whole reversed    # else, reversed_first is first k reversed, then add the rest as is.    # so the processed chunk is reversed_first + current_chunk[k:]    # but if len(current_chunk) <k, current_chunk[k:] is empty    processed = reversed_first + current_chunk[k:]    # append processed to the resultSo this logic works for all cases:Example 1: chunk is 'abcd' (len 4 >=2). reversed_first is 'ba', current_chunk[k:] is 'cd', so processed is 'bacd'.Example 2: chunk is 'efg' (len 3 >=2). reversed_first is 'fe', current_chunk[k:] is 'g' (since k=2, current_chunk[k:] is chunk[2:] → 'g'), so processed is 'feg'.Another test case: if the chunk has len 1. Then first_part is chunk[:k], which is the entire chunk. reversed_first is reversed of that. Then current_chunk[k:] is empty. So processed is reversed_first.If len is between k and 2k: for example, len 5, k=2. Then first_part is 2 characters, reversed. The rest is 3 characters, appended as is.So this code seems to handle all cases.So the function can be written as:def reverseStr(s, k):    result = []    for i in range(0, len(s), 2*k):        chunk = s[i:i+2*k]        reversed_part = chunk[:k][::-1]        processed = reversed_part + chunk[k:]        result.append(processed)    return ''.join(result)Wait, let's test this code with the sample input.Sample input: s = \\"abcdefg\\", k=2.Loop i in 0, 4, 8 (but 8 is beyond len(s) which is 7).i=0: chunk is 'abcd'. reversed_part is 'ab'[::-1] → 'ba'. processed is 'ba'+'cd' → 'bacd'.i=4: chunk is 'efg'. reversed_part is 'ef'[::-1] → 'fe'. processed is 'fe' + 'g' → 'feg'. i=8: out of range, loop ends.Result is 'bacd' + 'feg' → 'bacdfeg', which is correct.Another test case: s='a', k=1. Then loop i runs from 0. chunk is 'a'. reversed_part is 'a'[::-1] → 'a'. processed is 'a' + '' → 'a'. result is 'a'.Another test case: s='abc', k=2. So len(s) is 3. Loop i=0 and 4 (but 4 is beyond). At i=0: chunk is 'abc'. reversed_part is 'ab' → reversed to 'ba'. processed is 'ba' + 'c' → 'bac'. So the output is 'bac'.Another test: s='abcde', k=2. The chunks are 0-3 (abcd) and 4-8 (e). First chunk: reverse first 2 → 'ba' + 'cd' → 'bacd'. Second chunk: 'e' → reversed is 'e'. So output is 'bacd' + 'e' → 'bacde'.Wait according to the problem statement, in the case where the remaining is less than k (like the second chunk here is 'e', which is len 1 <k=2. So reverse all (so 'e' becomes 'e'), which is correct.So the code works.Another case: s='abcdefgh', k=3. Then 2k=6. So chunks are 0-5 (6 characters) and 6-11 (which is 'gh').First chunk: 'abcdef' (len 6). reverse first 3: 'cba def' → 'cbadef' ?Wait, the first 3 characters of 'abcdef' are 'abc', reversed to 'cba'. Then the remaining 3 are 'def', so the processed chunk is 'cba' + 'def' → 'cbadef'.Second chunk: s[6:6+6] → 'gh' (len 2). Since 2 <k=3, reverse all. 'gh' reversed is 'hg'. So the output is 'cbadefhg'.Is that correct according to the problem's rules?In the first 6 characters (2k=6), reverse first k=3. So yes. Then, the next chunk (6-11) is 'gh' which is less than k=3, reverse all. So yes. So code works.Therefore, the code is correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters in a given string.

The remaining characters in the chunk (if any) are appended as they are.- Handling Edge Cases: If a chunk has fewer than k characters, the entire chunk is reversed. If the chunk has between k and 2k characters, the first k characters are reversed, and the rest remain unchanged.- Efficiency: By iterating through the string in steps of 2k and using slicing, the solution efficiently processes each chunk in linear time relative to the length of the string, making the approach optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string."},{"problem":"Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

I need to find the maximum profit from buying and selling stock multiple times. The rules are that I can't hold more than one transaction at a time, so I have to sell before buying again. Hmm.So, the problem is similar to the classic \\"buy low, sell high\\" multiple times. But how do I approach this algorithmically? Let me think of the examples.In example 1, the prices are [7,1,5,3,6,4]. The best strategy is to buy at 1, sell at 5, then buy at 3 and sell at 6. Total profit is 4+3=7. Oh right, because each time you capture the increasing part of the prices. So maybe the approach is to sum all the consecutive increases. Like, whenever the next day's price is higher than today, buy today and sell tomorrow. But does that work?Let's take example 2: [1,2,3,4,5]. The max profit is 4, which is buying at 1 and selling at 5. But if I take each day's increase: 2-1=1, 3-2=1, etc. Summing 1+1+1+1=4. So that gives the same result. So actually, the total profit is the sum of all the positive differences between consecutive days. Because instead of buying once and selling at the end, multiple small transactions add up to the same.So the strategy here is to collect all the profits from every rising slope. That makes sense. Because each time you can sell and then buy again immediately the next day. So for any increasing sequence, like day i to day j where prices keep increasing, the total profit is prices[j] - prices[i], which is the same as summing each individual step (prices[i+1]-prices[i] + ... + prices[j] - prices[j-1]).So the algorithm can be as simple as adding up all the positive differences between consecutive days.So the steps would be:Initialize total profit to 0.Loop through the prices array from day 1 to end:   If current price is greater than previous day's price, add the difference to total profit.Return total profit.Wait, but what if the array is empty? Then return 0. Also, if there's only one day, no transactions possible.Let me test this approach with the examples.Example 1:Prices: [7,1,5,3,6,4]The consecutive differences are:1-7 = -6 (no profit)5-1 = +4 (add 4)3-5 = -2 (no)6-3 = +3 (add 3)4-6 = -2 (no)Total is 4+3=7. Which matches the example.Example 2:Prices: [1,2,3,4,5]Differences are 1,1,1,1. Sum is 4. Correct.Example 3:Prices are decreasing. All differences are negative. Sum is 0. Correct.So this approach works. Then the code is straightforward.So the Python function would loop through the array starting from index 1, compare each element with the previous one, add the positive difference to the total profit.Let me code that.The function will be called maxProfit, takes a list of integers as input.Initialize total_profit = 0.For i in range(1, len(prices)):   if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:       total_profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]Return total_profit.Yes, that's simple. Let me check edge cases.Edge case: empty list. The loop doesn't run, returns 0. Correct.If only one element, same. Correct.Another test case: [2,1,2,0,1]. The differences are -1, +1, -2, +1. So total profit is 1+1=2. Let's see:Buy at 1 (day 1), sell at 2 (day2). Then buy at 0 (day3), sell at 1 (day4). Profit 1 +1=2. Yes.So code works.So the code is straightforward.

ApproachThe key insight is that we can maximize our profit by capturing every possible upward trend in the stock prices.

Return Total Profit: After processing all days, the accumulated total profit is returned as the result.This approach efficiently captures all possible profits by leveraging the fact that summing up all small consecutive gains yields the same result as making fewer, larger transactions.

Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.Example 1:Input: \\"aba\\", \\"cdc\\"Output: 3Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is \\"aba\\" (or \\"cdc\\"), because \\"aba\\" is a subsequence of \\"aba\\", but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings. Note:Both strings' lengths will not exceed 100.Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. I need to find the longest uncommon subsequence between two strings. Hmm, what's an uncommon subsequence here? Oh right, it's a subsequence of one string that isn't a subsequence of the other. And the problem wants the length of the longest such subsequence. If there's none, return -1.Wait, let's think about the examples. Like the example given: \\"aba\\" and \\"cdc\\". The output is 3 because each is their own subsequence and not a subsequence of the other. So in that case, the answer is the maximum of the two lengths.But wait, what if one string is a subsequence of the other? Like, say a is \\"abc\\" and b is \\"abcd\\". Then the longest possible uncommon subsequence would be \\"abcd\\" (length 4) because it's a subsequence of b, but not a subsequence of a. Wait, but in this case, a is a subsequence of b. Then the longest uncommon subsequence would be the longer string. Because if a is a subsequence of b, then any subsequence of a is also a subsequence of b. So the longest possible for a is length 3, but since b is longer, the longest uncommon would be the length of b, 4.Wait, no. Because if a is a subsequence of b, then any subsequence of a is a subsequence of b. So the only way to have an uncommon subsequence is if it's longer than the other string. Or perhaps if the two strings are of the same length but different.So maybe the solution is: if the two strings are equal, then there's no uncommon subsequence (since every subseq of a is in a, which is same as b). So return -1. Otherwise, the answer is the maximum of the two lengths.Wait, that makes sense. Because, suppose a and b are different. Then the maximum of their lengths must be the answer. Because, take the longer string. Since the longer one can't be a subsequence of the shorter one (because it's longer), so the entire longer string is a subsequence of itself, but not of the shorter. So the LUS is the longer length. If they are same length but different, then neither is a subsequence of the other. So the LUS is their length.So the key is: if the two strings are the same, then return -1. Otherwise, return the maximum length of a and b.Wait, but how to check if they are the same? Because even if a is a subsequence of b and vice versa, but they are same, then their LUS is -1.So the steps are:Check if a and b are equal. If yes, return -1.Else, return the maximum of len(a) and len(b).But wait, what about cases where the strings are not equal but one is a subsequence of the other? For example, a is \\"abc\\" and b is \\"abd\\". They are not equal. The maximum length is 3. So the LUS would be 3, because either string can be used. Since \\"abc\\" is not a subsequence of \\"abd\\", right? Because the third character differs. So the entire string \\"abc\\" is not a subsequence of \\"abd\\". So the answer is 3.Another example: a is \\"a\\", b is \\"aa\\". Are they equal? No. So the maximum is 2. But is \\"aa\\" a subsequence of a? No. So the answer is 2. But wait, the entire \\"aa\\" is a subsequence of itself, and \\"a\\" is a subsequence of \\"aa\\". But the LUS is the longer string's length because the longer one can't be a subsequence of the shorter one. Because \\"aa\\" is longer than \\"a\\", so \\"aa\\" can't be a subsequence of \\"a\\". Therefore, the LUS is 2.Another example: a is \\"abc\\", b is \\"aebec\\". Wait, len(a) is 3, len(b) is 5. So the max is 5. But is \\"aebec\\" a subsequence of \\"abc\\"? No. So the answer is 5. Correct.But what if a is \\"abcde\\", and b is \\"ace\\". Then the max is 5. Since \\"abcde\\" is longer, and it's not a subsequence of \\"ace\\" (since it's longer). So the answer is 5.So the conclusion is that the answer is simply the max length of the two strings if they are different, else -1.Wait, but what if the two strings are of the same length but different? For example, a is \\"abc\\", b is \\"abd\\". Then the max length is 3. Since neither is a subsequence of the other. So the entire string (a) is a subsequence of itself but not of b, so the answer is 3.Yes. So this approach works.So the function can be written as:def findLUSlength(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:    if a == b:        return -1    else:        return max(len(a), len(b))Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose a is \\"aaa\\" and b is \\"aaa\\". Then return -1. Correct. But if a is \\"aaa\\" and b is \\"aaaa\\", then return 4. Which is correct because \\"aaaa\\" is not a subsequence of a (since a is shorter and \\"aaaa\\" is longer). So the answer is 4.But what about a case where the two strings are of the same length but different. Then the answer is that length. Because the entire string of a is a subsequence of a but not of b. So that's correct.But what if a is a subsequence of b, but they are different? For example, a is \\"abc\\", b is \\"abcde\\". Then a is a subsequence of b. So the LUS is 5. Because the entire b is not a subsequence of a. So the answer is 5.Yes.So the code is straightforward. The key insight is that the longest possible uncommon subsequence is either the entire a or the entire b, whichever is longer (and if they are same, then -1).Therefore, the code simply checks if the two strings are equal. If yes, return -1. Else, return the maximum of their lengths.So the function is as written above.I think that's the correct approach. Let's see some test cases.Test case 1:Input: \\"aba\\", \\"cdc\\" → Output 3. Since they are different, max(3,3) is 3.Test case 2:Input: \\"aaa\\", \\"aaa\\" → Output -1.Test case 3:a=\\"abc\\", b=\\"abd\\" → output 3.Test case 4:a=\\"a\\", b=\\"aa\\" → output 2.All these cases fit.Therefore, the code should be correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between two given strings.

Let's think about how to approach this.First, let's understand the problem. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. For example, if the array is [1,4,2,5,3], then the odd-length subarrays are all subarrays of length 1, 3, 5, etc. So for each possible odd length (1,3,5... up to the length of the array), we need to consider every possible starting index and sum those subarrays.The brute force approach would be to iterate over all possible odd lengths, then for each length, iterate over all possible starting indices, extract the subarray, calculate the sum, and add it to the total. But wait, for arrays of length up to 100, this approach might not be too bad. Let's check the time complexity.Suppose the array has n elements. The number of possible odd lengths is (n + 1) // 2. For each length l (which is 1,3,5,... up to n), there are (n - l + 1) possible starting positions. For each subarray of length l, summing its elements takes O(l) time. So the total time complexity would be O(n^3) in the worst case. For n=100, that's 100 * 50 * 100 (since for each l, which can be up to 100, the number of subarrays is (100 - l +1), and each sum is O(l)). Hmm, 100*50*100 is 500,000 operations. That's acceptable, right? So maybe a brute force approach is feasible here.But maybe there's a smarter way to do this. Let's think about how each element contributes to the total sum. For each element arr[i], how many times does it appear in an odd-length subarray? If I can find that count for each element, then the total sum is the sum of arr[i] multiplied by its count.So the key is to find the number of odd-length subarrays that include each element arr[i]. Then multiply each element by its count and sum all those products.So how to compute the count for each element?Let's think about the position i in the array. For a subarray to include arr[i], the subarray must start at some index <= i and end at some index >= i. The length of the subarray is (end - start + 1), which must be odd.But perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute how many subarrays of odd length include arr[i].Another approach: For each element arr[i], the number of subarrays where arr[i] is included and the subarray has odd length. Let's find that.The number of possible starting indices can be from 0 to i, and the number of possible ending indices from i to n-1. The total number of possible subarrays that include arr[i] is (i + 1) * (n - i). Because the start can be any of the (i+1) choices (0 to i), and the end can be any of (n - i) choices (i to n-1). But we need only those subarrays whose length is odd.The length of a subarray from start to end is (end - start + 1). We need this to be odd.So, for each possible start and end that includes i, if (end - start + 1) is odd, then it's an odd-length subarray that includes arr[i].Wait, but how do we count the number of such pairs (start, end) that include i and have odd length.Alternatively, for each element arr[i], the number of subarrays of odd length that include arr[i] is equal to the number of subarrays where the start is <= i and end is >= i and (end - start + 1) is odd.Alternatively, perhaps we can split the problem into left and right possibilities. The number of possible choices for start (left side) and end (right side) such that the total length is odd.Let me think. Let's fix the element at index i. The total number of subarrays that include arr[i] is (i + 1) * (n - i) as before. But among these, how many have odd length?The length is (end - start +1) must be odd. So end - start must be even. Let's let l = start, r = end. Then (r - l) must be even. So r = l + 2k for some integer k >=0.But since the subarray must include i, l <= i <= r. So l <= i <= l + 2k. Which implies that l <= i and l + 2k >= i. Hmm, this might complicate things.Alternatively, for a given i, the subarrays that include arr[i] can be split into those where the subarray's center is at i, but that might not capture all possibilities.Another idea: For each element arr[i], the number of subarrays of odd length that include arr[i] is equal to the number of possible left choices multiplied by the number of possible right choices, where the left and right choices are such that the total length is odd.Let me think. For each possible start (l) <= i, and end (r) >= i. The subarray from l to r must have (r - l +1) odd.The total number of such pairs (l, r) is the number of ways to choose l and r such that l <= i <= r and (r - l +1) is odd.We can split this into possible left and right choices. For each possible l, how many r >=i can we choose such that (r - l +1) is odd and r >=i.Alternatively, for a fixed l <=i, the possible r's are >=i and >= l, and (r - l +1) is odd. So (r - l +1) must be odd, so (r - l) is even. So r can be l, l+2, l+4, etc. But r must be >=i and <=n-1 (since end is up to n-1).So for a given l, the possible r's start from max(i, l) and go up to n-1 in steps of 2.Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.Another approach: For each element i, the number of possible odd-length subarrays that include it is equal to the number of pairs (left, right) where left is the number of elements to the left of i (including i) that can be chosen as the start, and right is the number of elements to the right of i (including i) that can be chosen as the end, such that the total length (left + right -1) is odd. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, the number of ways to choose the start and end such that the subarray includes i and has odd length can be determined by considering the parity of the left and right parts.Let me consider the elements to the left of i (including i) and the elements to the right of i (including i). For example, the number of possible choices for start is left_choices = i - l +1 (if l is the start). Wait, perhaps for each element i, the number of possible starts is (i +1) choices (since start can be from 0 to i), and the number of possible ends is (n - i) choices (end can be from i to n-1). But how many of these pairs (start, end) result in an odd-length subarray?The length is (end - start +1). So the parity depends on end - start. Since (end - start +1) is odd if and only if (end - start) is even.So the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (s, e) where s <= i <= e, and (e - s) is even.Hmm. So for each element i, we need to find the number of (s, e) pairs such that s <=i <=e and e -s is even.This seems challenging. Let's think of possible ways to model this.Suppose for each i, we can compute:The number of ways to choose s and e where s <=i, e >=i, and e -s is even.Alternatively, for each i, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of even-length intervals that include i.Wait, perhaps this is getting us stuck. Let's think of specific examples.Take the example in the first sample input: arr = [1,4,2,5,3], n=5.Take i=2 (element 2). Let's compute how many subarrays of odd length include it.Possible starts s can be 0,1,2. Possible ends e can be 2,3,4.The pairs (s,e) where s <=2 <=e and e-s is even.So for s=0:e can be 2 (0,2: length 3, which is odd. e-s=2, which is even), e=4 (0-4: length 5, e-s=4 even. So two possibilities.For s=1:e can be 2 (1-2: length 2, even. Wait, wait, the length is e-s+1=2, which is even. So this is not counted. Wait, wait. Because (e-s) must be even. So (e-s) =1, which is odd. So e-s+1=2, even. So no. So for s=1, e must be such that e-s is even → e=1+even. So possible e values >=2. So for s=1, e can be 1 (but e >=i=2? No. So e can be 2 (e-s=1, which is odd → length 2, even. Not allowed. Or e=3: e-s=2 → even → length 3. So yes. Or e=4: e-s=3 → odd → length 4. So allowed? Wait no. Wait, (e-s) is even. So for s=1, e must be 1+2k. So possible e's >=i=2. So e can be 3 (e-s=2) and 5 (but array ends at 4). So for s=1, e can be 3 (since 3-1=2 even). So the subarray is 1 to 3: length 3. So that's allowed.So for s=1, e=3: yes. And e=5 is beyond the array. So only one possibility here.For s=2: e can be 2 (length 1, odd), e=4 (e-s=2 → even → length 3). So two possibilities.So total for i=2:s=0: e=2 and 4 → 2.s=1: e=3 →1.s=2: e=2 and 4 →2.Total 2+1+2=5. So the element 2 is included in 5 subarrays of odd length. In the example, the subarrays that include 2 in odd-length are:[2] (length 1),[1,4,2], [4,2,5], [2,5,3] (each of length 3),[1,4,2,5,3] (length 5). Wait, but wait, the subarrays that include 2:Wait, the subarrays of length 1: [2] → count 1.Length 3: [1,4,2], [4,2,5], [2,5,3] → each includes 2. So 3.Length 5: the entire array. So 1.Total 1+3+1=5. Which matches the count of 5.So the element 2 contributes 2*5=10 to the total sum. Which in the example, the sum of the subarrays that include 2 is:[2] →2,[1,4,2] →7 (sum includes 2),[4,2,5] →11 (sum includes 2),[2,5,3] →10 (sum includes 2),[1,4,2,5,3] →15 (sum includes 2). So the total contribution is 2 + 7 (sum includes 2) → but wait, no. Wait, the contribution of the element 2 is 2 multiplied by the number of times it appears in all such subarrays. So each subarray that includes 2 adds 2 once. So the number of such subarrays is 5, so 2*5=10. Which is correct.So the approach of multiplying each element by the number of times it appears in odd-length subarrays and then summing all those products would work.So the key is to find for each element arr[i], the number of odd-length subarrays that include it. Then sum all arr[i] * count[i].Now, the problem reduces to computing count[i] for each i.So how do we compute count[i]?Let me think again. For each element i (0-based), the count is the number of (s, e) pairs where s <=i <=e and (e - s +1) is odd. Which is equivalent to (e - s) being even.So (e - s) mod 2 ==0.So for each i, we can split the problem into two parts: the possible starts s (0<=s<=i) and possible ends e (i<=e <n), such that (e-s) is even.So for each i, count[i] is the sum over all s <=i of the number of e >=i where (e-s) is even.Let me consider s and e such that s <=i <=e and (e - s) is even.Let me fix s. Then for this s, e must be >=i, and >=s (since e >=s), and (e -s) even. So e can be s, s+2, s+4, etc., up to the maximum possible (n-1).So for a given s, the number of valid e's is the number of integers e >= max(s, i) such that e <=n-1 and e ≡ s mod 2 (since e-s must be even → e and s have the same parity).So for each s (<=i), the possible e's start at e_start = max(s, i). Then, the e's must be >=e_start, <=n-1, and congruent to s mod 2.The number of such e's is floor(( (n-1 - e_start) ) / 2 ) + 1, if e_start and s have the same parity.Wait, let's take an example.Suppose s is 0 (even), i=2, n=5. e must be >=2, and have the same parity as s (even). So possible e's are 2,4. So two e's. So count is 2.Another example: s=1 (odd), i=2, n=5. e must be >=2, and have same parity as s (odd). So possible e's are 3. So count is 1.So for each s, the number of valid e's is:start_e = max(s, i)if start_e > n-1 → 0else:the first e is start_e if start_e ≡ s mod 2. Else, start_e +1 (if possible).Wait, perhaps a better way is:The parity of start_e must be the same as s. If not, we need to adjust start_e to the next possible e.Alternatively, the possible e's are in the sequence: start_e, start_e +2, ... up to n-1.But how to calculate the count.The formula would be:count_e = ((n-1 - start_e) + (parity_diff)) // 2 + 1Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:The number of elements from a to b inclusive where each step is 2 is ((b - a) // 2) + 1.So in this case, a is start_e if (start_e - s) is even (same parity). Otherwise, a is start_e +1 (but that has to be <=n-1).Wait, let's calculate the first possible e >= start_e, >=i, and e ≡ s mod 2.The first such e is:if (start_e - s) is even → start_e.else → start_e +1.But start_e +1 must be <=n-1.So the first e is:if (start_e % 2) == (s % 2), then e_min = start_e.else, e_min = start_e +1.But e_min must be <=n-1.If e_min exceeds n-1, then no e's.Once we have e_min, the maximum e is n-1.The number of e's is ((n-1 - e_min) // 2) +1, if e_min <=n-1.Else 0.But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's see.The parity of s is fixed. For a given s, the parity of e must be the same as s's parity.So for e >= start_e (which is max(s, i)), the possible e's are those with parity same as s, and >= start_e.So the possible e's can be written as:e = start_e + k*2, where k >=0, and e <=n-1.So the maximum k is floor( (n-1 - start_e) / 2 )So the count is (max_k +1) if start_e is <=n-1 and (start_e's parity is same as s's). Otherwise, if start_e's parity is different, then start_e +1 is the first possible e, and so on.Alternatively, the number of e's can be calculated as:if (start_e > n-1) → 0.else:the number of e's is (( (n-1 - (start_e)) + (s % 2 == start_e % 2 ? 0 : 1 )) // 2 ) +1 ?Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of examples.Case 1: s is even, start_e is even. Then e can be start_e, start_e+2, etc. The count is ((n-1 - start_e)/2) +1.Case 2: s is even, start_e is odd. Then the first possible e is start_e +1 (since that would be even). Then, the next e is start_e +3, etc. So count is ((n-1 - (start_e +1 )) / 2) +1, if start_e +1 <=n-1.So general formula:start_e = max(s, i)if start_e >n-1 → 0.else:delta_parity = (start_e - s) % 2 → if 0, same parity, else different.If delta_parity is 0:the first e is start_e. The last e is (n-1) if (n-1 - start_e) is even? Or just the maximum possible.The number of e's is ((n-1 - start_e) // 2) +1.If delta_parity is 1:the first e is start_e +1. If this is >n-1 → 0. Otherwise, the number is ((n-1 - (start_e+1)) //2 ) +1.So putting it all together:count_e = 0start_e = max(s, i)if start_e >n-1:    count_e =0else:    if (start_e -s) %2 ==0:        count_e = ((n-1 - start_e) //2 ) +1    else:        new_start = start_e +1        if new_start >n-1:            count_e =0        else:            count_e = ((n-1 - new_start) //2 ) +1But this seems a bit involved. However, this can be computed for each s and i.But for each element i, this would require O(n) time (since we have to check each possible s up to i). Then for n elements, this would be O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for n=100 (10^4 operations).So the plan is:For each i in 0..n-1:    total =0    for s in 0..i:        start_e = max(s, i)        if start_e >=n:            continue        # compute delta_parity between start_e and s.        delta_parity = (start_e -s) %2        if delta_parity ==0:            first_e = start_e        else:            first_e = start_e +1        if first_e >=n:            continue        last_e = n-1        # how many e's from first_e to last_e, stepping by 2.        if first_e > last_e:            continue        count = (last_e - first_e) //2 +1        total += count    count[i] = totalThen sum all arr[i] * count[i].This seems feasible.Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula for count[i] that can be derived.Let me think again. For a given i, the number of subarrays that include i and have odd length.Each subarray is determined by how many elements are chosen to the left and right of i. For example, if we choose k elements to the left of i (so the start is i-k), and m elements to the right (so the end is i+m), then the length is (k + m +1) (since i-k to i+m is m +k +1 elements). For the length to be odd, k + m +1 must be odd → k +m must be even. So k and m must be both even or both odd.The number of ways to choose k and m such that k is in 0..i (since the left can't go beyond 0) and m is in 0..(n-1 -i) (since the right can't go beyond n-1), and (k +m) is even.The total number of pairs (k, m) is (i+1) * (n - i). But we need to count only those pairs where (k +m) is even.So the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (k, m) where 0<=k<=i, 0<=m <=(n-1 -i), and (k +m) is even.The count of such pairs is equal to:(number of even k in 0..i) * (number of even m in 0..(n-1 -i)) + (number of odd k in 0..i) * (number of odd m in 0..(n-1 -i)).Because even + even is even, odd + odd is even.So for each i, the count[i] is equal to:even_left = (i // 2 + 1) if i is even else ((i+1)//2)Wait, let's see: for example, when i=0 (0-based), the left can have k=0 (even). So even_left=1.For i=1: possible k=0 (even), k=1 (odd). even_left=1, odd_left=1.For i=2: k can be 0,1,2. even numbers are 0,2 → even_left=2. odd is 1 →1.Wait, for i=2:k ranges from 0 to 2 (inclusive). Even k's are 0,2 → count 2. Odd k's are 1 → count 1.Similarly for the right (m):m ranges from 0 to (n-1 -i). Let's call the right length R = (n-1 -i) +1 (since m can be 0 up to (n-1 -i), so R is the number of possible m values).So for the right, even_right is the number of even m's in 0..(R-1), which is (R //2 + (R %2 ==0 ? 0 : ( (R-1) %2 ==0 ? 1 :0 )) )). Wait, perhaps more simply:even_right = (R +1) //2 if R is even? Or wait:For R elements (m from 0 to R-1):number of even m's is (R //2) if R is even, else (R+1)//2.Wait, for R=3 (elements 0,1,2):even m's are 0,2 → count 2. (R=3, (3+1)//2=2).For R=4 (0,1,2,3): even m's are 0,2 → count 2. (4//2=2).Yes, so even_right = (R +1) //2.Similarly, odd_right = R //2.So the formula becomes:even_left = (i +2) // 2 → no, wait. Let's think.For the left side (k from 0 to i inclusive):number of even k's: floor((i)/2) + 1 if i is even? Or (i +1 +1)/2 ?Wait for i=0: even k's count is 1.i=0 is even. (0//2) +1 =0 +1=1.i=1: 0 and 1. Even count is 1 (only 0). So (1+1)//2=1.i=2: 0,1,2. Even counts 2 (0 and 2). (2+1 +1)/2= (3+1)/2=2? No. Wait, 2+1=3. (3+1)/2=2.Wait, the number of even k's in 0..i is (i//2 +1) when i is even, and (i//2 +1) when i is odd?Wait:i is even: 0,1,...,i.Number of even k's is (i/2) +1. Because 0,2,4,...i → (i/2)+1 terms.For i even: i=2k → even k's: 0,2,...2k → k+1 terms.So (i/2 +1) = (2k/2 +1) =k+1.Yes.For i odd: i=2k+1. Even k's are 0,2,...2k → k+1 terms.But i//2 =k → (i//2 +1) =k+1.So in general, the number of even k's is (i//2 +1).The number of odd k's is (i+1) - even_left → which is (i+1) - (i//2 +1) = i - i//2.For example, i=3:even k's: 0,2 → count 2 (3//2 +1=1+1=2).odd k's: 3+1 -2=4-2=2 → 1,3.Yes.So even_left = (i //2 ) + 1.Similarly for the right side:R = (n-1 -i) +1 = n -i.Because m ranges from 0 to (n-1 -i), which is R = (n-1 -i) +1 =n -i elements.So even_right = (R +1) //2.Similarly, odd_right = R //2.So the formula for count[i] is:count[i] = even_left * even_right + odd_left * odd_right.Where:even_left = (i //2) + 1odd_left = (i +1) - even_left = (i+1) - (i//2 +1) = i - i//2.even_right = ( (n -i) +1 ) // 2odd_right = (n -i) // 2So putting this all together:count[i] = even_left * even_right + odd_left * odd_right.This is a mathematical formula that can be computed in O(1) time for each i. This would make the overall algorithm O(n) time, which is much better than the previous approaches.So now, the algorithm becomes:Compute for each i:even_left = (i //2 ) + 1odd_left = (i +1) - even_leftR = n -ieven_right = (R +1) // 2odd_right = R // 2count_i = even_left * even_right + odd_left * odd_rightsum += arr[i] * count_iThis is a much more efficient approach. Let's test this with the sample input.Sample 1: arr = [1,4,2,5,3], n=5.For i=0 (element 1):even_left = (0//2) +1=0+1=1odd_left = 0+1 -1=0.R=5-0=5.even_right = (5 +1)//2 =6//2=3.odd_right=5//2=2.count_i=1*3 +0*2=3.So element 1 is included in 3 subarrays of odd length. Looking at the sample:The subarrays that include 1 are:[1], [1,4,2], [1,4,2,5,3]. So 3 → correct.Then 1*3=3.For i=1 (element 4):even_left = (1//2) +1=0+1=1.odd_left = 1+1-1=1.R=5-1=4.even_right=(4+1)//2=5//2=2.odd_right=4//2=2.count_i=1*2 +1*2=2+2=4.Element 4 is in the subarrays:[4], [1,4,2], [4,2,5], [1,4,2,5,3]. That's 4 subarrays. 4 → correct. So 4*4=16.For i=2 (element 2):even_left = (2//2) +1=1+1=2.odd_left=2+1 -2=1.R=5-2=3.even_right=(3+1)//2=4//2=2.odd_right=3//2=1.count_i=2*2 +1*1=4+1=5 → correct. So 2*5=10.For i=3 (element5):even_left=3//2 +1=1+1=2.odd_left=3+1 -2=2.R=5-3=2.even_right=(2+1)/2=3//2=1.odd_right=2//2=1.count_i=2*1 +2*1=2+2=4.The subarrays including 5 are [5], [4,2,5], [2,5,3], [1,4,2,5,3]. That's 4 → correct. So 5*4=20.For i=4 (element3):even_left=4//2 +1=2+1=3.But wait, i=4. even_left =4//2 +1=2+1=3.Wait, for i=4, possible k's are 0,1,2,3,4. Even k's are 0,2,4 → 3 elements. So even_left=3.odd_left=5-3=2.R=5-4=1.even_right=(1+1)/2=1.odd_right=0.count_i=3*1 +2*0=3.Element3 is in [3], [2,5,3], [1,4,2,5,3]. 3 subarrays. So 3*3=9. Sum is 3+16+10+20+9=58. Which matches the sample.This works.Another sample: input [1,2], n=2.i=0:even_left=0+1=1.odd_left=1-1=0.R=2-0=2.even_right=(2+1)/2=1.5 → floored to 1?Wait, the code for even_right is (R +1) //2. For R=2, (2+1)//2=3//2=1.5 → but integer division gives 1.So even_right=1. odd_right=2//2=1.count_i=1*1 +0*1=1.So element1 contributes 1*1=1.i=1:even_left=1//2+1=0+1=1.odd_left=2-1=1.R=2-1=1.even_right=(1+1)//2=1.odd_right=1//2=0.count_i=1*1 +1*0=1.So element2 contributes 2*1=2.Total sum is 1+2=3, which matches sample 2.So the formula works.So the plan is to compute for each element, using this formula, multiply by the element, and sum all.So the code can be written as follows:Initialize sum_total to 0.Loop over each index i in arr:   compute even_left = (i //2) +1   odd_left = (i +1) - even_left   R = len(arr) - i   even_right = (R +1) // 2   odd_right = R //2   count_i = even_left * even_right + odd_left * odd_right   sum_total += arr[i] * count_iReturn sum_total.So this code will be O(n) time, which is efficient even for large n.Thus, this is the optimal approach.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays of a given array. A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array. The key insight is to determine how many times each element in the array appears in all odd-length subarrays and then use this count to compute the total sum efficiently. Approach1. Understanding Subarray Contributions: Each element in the array contributes to the sum of multiple odd-length subarrays. The goal is to determine how many times each element appears in these subarrays.2.

Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false. Example 1:Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]Output: trueExample 2:Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]Output: falseExample 3:Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]Output: false Constraints:rect1.length == 4rect2.length == 4-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109rec1[0] <= rec1[2] and rec1[1] <= rec1[3]rec2[0] <= rec2[2] and rec2[1] <= rec2[3]","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if two axis-aligned rectangles overlap. Let's think about how to approach this.First, the problem says that two rectangles overlap if their intersection area is positive. So, just touching edges or corners doesn't count. So, how do rectangles not overlap? Well, if one is completely to the left, right, above, or below the other, then they don't overlap. Otherwise, they do.Let me visualize the rectangles. Let's take rec1 as [x1, y1, x2, y2] and rec2 as [a1, b1, a2, b2]. So, for them to not overlap, one of these conditions must be true:1. rec1 is to the left of rec2: rec1's right edge is <= rec2's left edge. So x2 <= a1.2. rec1 is to the right of rec2: rec2's right edge is <= rec1's left edge. So a2 <= x1.3. rec1 is below rec2: rec1's top edge is <= rec2's bottom edge. So y2 <= b1.4. rec1 is above rec2: rec2's top edge is <= rec1's bottom edge. So b2 <= y1.If any of these conditions are true, then the rectangles do NOT overlap. Otherwise, they do overlap.Wait, right. Because if none of these conditions are true, then there's some overlapping in both x and y directions. For example, their projections on the x-axis overlap, and projections on y-axis overlap. So the intersection area would be positive.So the logic is to check if the rectangles are not overlapping in any direction. If they are not in any one direction, return false. Otherwise, return true.So the function should check if the conditions for non-overlapping are not met. So the overlap occurs when all of the non-overlapping conditions are false.So putting it all together:Check if (x2 <= a1) is false, (a2 <= x1) is false, (y2 <= b1) is false, (b2 <= y1) is false. If all four are false, then return True. Otherwise, return False.Wait, wait. Wait, the four conditions are the four cases where they don't overlap. If any of those four conditions is true, then the rectangles do not overlap. So the function should return True only when none of the four conditions are true.So the code would be: return not (any of the four conditions). So in code:return not (x2 <= a1 or a2 <= x1 or y2 <= b1 or b2 <= y1)But wait, let's take example 1:rec1 is [0,0,2,2], rec2 [1,1,3,3]Check each condition:x2 (2) <= a1 (1)? No. a2 (3) <= x1 (0)? No. y2 (2) <= b1 (1)? No. b2 (3) <= y1 (0)? No. So none are true, so return true. Correct.Example 2:rec1 [0,0,1,1], rec2 [1,0,2,1]Check:x2 (1) <= a1 (1)? 1 <=1: yes. So condition 1 is true. So return false. Because any of the four conditions is true. So the overall result is false. Correct.Example 3:rec1 [0,0,1,1], rec2 [2,2,3,3]. So x2 is 1 <= a1 2? 1<=2: yes. So condition1 is true. So return false. Correct.So that logic works.So the code would take the two rectangles, extract their coordinates, then check if any of the four non-overlapping conditions are true. If any is, return false. Otherwise, return true.But wait, let me think about the coordinates. For rec1, the x1 is the left, x2 the right. Similarly for the other rectangle. So a1 is the left of rec2.So the code would be:def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:    x1, y1, x2, y2 = rec1    a1, b1, a2, b2 = rec2    # Check if there's no overlap in x or y direction    overlap_x = not (x2 <= a1 or a2 <= x1)    overlap_y = not (y2 <= b1 or b2 <= y1)    return overlap_x and overlap_yWait, that's another way to think. For overlap to occur, both x and y projections must overlap. So the x projections overlap when the left of one is less than the right of the other, and vice versa.So, x overlap is when (x1 < a2) and (a1 < x2). Because if the left of rec1 is before the right of rec2, and the left of rec2 is before the right of rec1. If either of those is not true, then no overlap in x.Similarly for y. So overlap_x can be written as (x1 < a2) and (a1 < x2). Similarly for y.So, the code can be written as:return (x1 < a2) and (a1 < x2) and (y1 < b2) and (b1 < y2)Wait, let me check that. For example 1:x1 is 0 < a2 (3) is true. a1 (1) < x2 (2) is true. So x overlaps. y1 (0) < b2 (3), yes. b1 (1) < y2 (2), yes. So all four conditions are true. So returns true.Example 2:x1 (0) < a2 (2) yes. a1 (1) < x2 (1) no. So one condition is false. So returns false.Example 3: x1 (0) < a2 (3) yes. a1 (2) < x2 (1) no. So returns false.Yes. So this approach also works. Which way is better?Well, perhaps the second approach is more straightforward. So, to check that the left of each is less than the right of the other in both x and y directions.So, the code would be:def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:    x1, y1, x2, y2 = rec1    a1, b1, a2, b2 = rec2    # Check x overlap: rec1's left < rec2's right and rec2's left < rec1's right    # Similarly for y    return (x1 < a2) and (a1 < x2) and (y1 < b2) and (b1 < y2)Wait, but the coordinates are given as x1 <= x2 and same for the other rectangle. So x1 is always <= x2, a1 <=a2, etc. So the conditions like x1 < a2 and a1 <x2 would check if the x ranges overlap. Because if rec1's left is to the left of rec2's right, and rec2's left is to the left of rec1's right, then their x projections overlap. Same for y.Yes. So that's the correct condition.Wait, but what if the rectangles are touching? Like example 2 where x1 is 0, x2 is 1. rec2 has a1=1, a2=2. So x1 < a2 is 0 < 2: true. a1 <x2 is 1 <1: false. So returns false, which is correct.So, yes, this condition works.So the code is as above. So the function can be written that way.Testing the examples:Example 1: returns true. Correct.Example 2: returns false. Correct.Example3: returns false. Correct.So this should work.Now, edge cases.

Then x1=0 < a2=2: yes. a1=0 <x2=2: yes. Similarly for y. So returns true. Which is correct, as they are the same rectangle.What about when two rectangles share an edge but no area? Like rec1 [0,0,1,1], rec2 [1,0,2,1]. Then x2 is 1, a1 is 1. So x1 <a2 (0 <2) is true. a1 <x2 (1 <1) is false. So returns false. Correct.Another test case: rec1 and rec2 touch at the corner. Like rec1 [0,0,1,1], rec2 [1,1,2,2]. Then x1 <a2 (0 <2) yes. a1 <x2 (1 <1) no. So returns false.

The key insight is that two rectangles overlap if their projections on both the x-axis and y-axis overlap. If either projection does not overlap, the rectangles do not overlap. ApproachThe approach involves checking the projections of both rectangles on the x-axis and y-axis. For the rectangles to overlap:1. The left edge of the first rectangle must be less than the right edge of the second rectangle.2. The left edge of the second rectangle must be less than the right edge of the first rectangle.3. The bottom edge of the first rectangle must be less than the top edge of the second rectangle.4.

Let's see what the problem says. So, two strings are isomorphic if each character in s can be mapped to a character in t such that replacing all occurrences in s gives t. But there's a catch: no two characters can map to the same character. Oh right, and the order has to be preserved. So like, the first character in s maps to the first in t, etc. Also, the lengths are the same, so that's a given.Hmm, examples. Like in example 1, \\"egg\\" and \\"add\\" are isomorphic. So e maps to a, g maps to d. Then in example 2, \\"foo\\" vs \\"bar\\"—f maps to b, o maps to a, but then the second o would also map to a, but when we get to r, there's no o left. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, \\"foo\\" is f, o, o. \\"bar\\" is b, a, r. So first o maps to a, second o would need to map to r? Or maybe not. Wait, no. The problem says that all occurrences of a character must be replaced. So in \\"foo\\", both o's need to map to the same character in t. But in t's case, \\"bar\\" has a, then r. So the first o maps to a, but then the second o would have to map to r, which is different. So that's a conflict. Hence, they are not isomorphic. That's why example 2 returns false.So the core idea is to check that each character in s maps to exactly one character in t, and vice versa. Because if two characters in s map to the same character in t, that would violate the rule that no two characters can map to the same. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that no two characters may map to the same character. Wait, the problem says, \\"No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.\\" So that's a bijection? Like, each s character maps to a unique t character, and each t character is mapped by exactly one s character. Because if two s characters mapped to the same t character, that's not allowed. Wait, the note says: All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character. So, for example, in s = \\"aa\\" and t = \\"bb\\", that's okay: a maps to b. But if s is \\"ab\\" and t is \\"bb\\", then a maps to b, and b maps to b. But then two different characters in s (a and b) are mapping to the same character in t (b). That's not allowed, so this should return false.So the key is to check for a one-to-one mapping both ways. So each character in s must map to exactly one character in t, and each character in t must be mapped to by exactly one character in s.So how to model this. Maybe using two dictionaries. One for mapping from s to t, and another for t to s. Because if you only check one direction, you might miss the reverse case. For example, if s has two characters mapping to the same t character, the forward dict would catch it. But if t has two characters mapped by different s characters, that would require the reverse dict.Wait, let's think. Let's say we have a dict s_map that maps each character in s to the corresponding character in t, and a dict t_map that maps each character in t to the corresponding character in s.For each pair of characters (s_char, t_char) at the same position:- If s_char is in s_map, check that s_map[s_char] == t_char. If not, return False.- Else, add s_map[s_char] = t_char.- Similarly, check if t_char is in t_map, and if so, t_map[t_char] must be s_char. Else, add it.Wait, but perhaps that's redundant. Because for the mapping to be valid, each s_char must map to a unique t_char and vice versa. So for example, if s has two different characters a and b, and both map to x in t, that's invalid. So using the s_map, when a is mapped to x, then when b comes along and tries to map to x, the s_map for b would be x, but then in the t_map, x must be mapped back to a, but if b is also trying to map to x, then the t_map would already have x pointing to a, so when processing the pair (b, x), we check if t_map[x] is a. Since in this case, s_char is b, and t_map[x] is a, which is not equal to b. So we return False.So by using both mappings, we can ensure that both directions are one-to-one.So the algorithm would be:Initialize two dictionaries: s_to_t and t_to_s.Iterate through each pair of characters (s_char, t_char) in s and t.For each pair:- Check if s_char is in s_to_t. If it is, check that the corresponding value is t_char. If not, return False.- Check if t_char is in t_to_s. If it is, check that the corresponding value is s_char. If not, return False.- If neither is present, add s_to_t[s_char] = t_char and t_to_s[t_char] = s_char.If all pairs are processed without issues, return True.Yes, that should work. Let's test this logic against the examples.Example 1: s = \\"egg\\", t = \\"add\\".Indices 0: e and a. Both not in the maps. Add s_to_t['e'] = 'a', t_to_s['a'] = 'e'.Index 1: g and d. Neither is present. Add s_to_t['g'] = 'd', t_to_s['d'] = 'g'.Index 2: g and d. s_to_t['g'] is 'd', which matches. t_to_s['d'] is 'g', which matches the s_char 'g'. So ok. So return True.Example 2: s = \\"foo\\", t = \\"bar\\".Index 0: f and b. Add to maps.Index1: o and a. Add to maps.Index2: o and r. Now, check s_to_t['o'] is 'a', but current t_char is 'r'. So s_to_t['o'] is 'a' != 'r' → return False. So correct.Another example: s = \\"paper\\", t = \\"title\\".p → t, a→i, p→t, e→l, r→e.Wait, let's see:s: p a p e rt: t i t l eProcess each pair:0: p and t → add to both maps. s_to_t['p'] = 't', t_to_s['t'] = 'p'.1: a and i → add. s_to_t['a'] = 'i', t_to_s['i'] = 'a'.2: p and t. s_to_t[p] is t, which matches. t_to_s[t] is p, which matches the current s_char p. So okay.3: e and l → add.4: r and e → add.So all checks pass. So return True.Another test case: s=\\"ab\\", t=\\"aa\\".s_to_t: a→a. Then, for the second character, s_char is b. t_char is a. So check if s_char b is in s_to_t → no. Then check if t_char a is in t_to_s → yes, it's mapped to a. Wait, t_to_s[a] is a (from the first step). So when processing the second pair (b, a), we check if t_char a is in t_to_s. It is, and the corresponding s_char is a. But current s_char is b. So this would fail. So returns False. Which is correct, since two different s characters (a and b) are trying to map to the same t character (a).So the logic works.Now, coding this in Python.So the function is named isIsomorphic, takes s and t as parameters, returns a boolean.We can proceed as:Initialize two dictionaries. Let's say s_map and t_map.Loop over each pair of characters in s and t. Since the lengths are same (as per note), no need to check.For each i in range(len(s)):s_char = s[i]t_char = t[i]Check if s_char in s_map:   if s_map[s_char] != t_char → return False.Else:   check if t_char in t_map:       if t_map[t_char] != s_char → return False.   else:       add to both maps.Wait, no. Wait, the steps should be:For each pair (s_char, t_char):if s_char is in s_map:   if s_map[s_char] != t_char → invalid, return False.else:   if t_char is in t_map:       if t_map[t_char] != s_char → invalid, return False.   else:       add s_map[s_char] = t_char       add t_map[t_char] = s_charWait, but what if the s_char is not in s_map, but the t_char is already in t_map? For example, s_char is new, but t_char is already mapped to some other s character.So in this case, adding s_char → t_char would create a conflict, because t_char is already mapped to another s_char. Hence, the check is needed.So in code:for each pair:   if s_char in s_map:       if s_map[s_char] != t_char → False   else:       if t_char in t_map:           # because t_char is already mapped to some s_char_prev. So current s_char is new, but t_char is already in t_map. So this would map two different s_chars (s_char_prev and current s_char) to the same t_char. Which violates the 'no two characters may map to the same' rule.           # So this is invalid.           if t_map[t_char] != s_char → False       else:           # add both mappings.           s_map[s_char] = t_char           t_map[t_char] = s_charSo in code:for i in range(len(s)):    sc, tc = s[i], t[i]    if sc in s_map:        if s_map[sc] != tc:            return False    else:        if tc in t_map:            if t_map[tc] != sc:                return False        else:            s_map[sc] = tc            t_map[tc] = scSo that's the logic.Let me test this code.Test case where s is \\"ab\\" and t is \\"aa\\".Processing first pair: a and a.s_map is empty. So sc a not in s_map. tc a not in t_map. So add s_map['a'] = 'a', t_map['a'] = 'a'.Second pair: b and a.sc b not in s_map. Check tc a is in t_map. Yes. Then check t_map['a'] is 'a' != b. So return False. Correct.Another test case: s=\\"egg\\", t=\\"add\\".First pair e,a → added. Then g,d. Then next g is checked against d. All correct.Another test case where s and t are \\"paper\\" and \\"title\\". The code should process all pairs correctly.So this logic should handle all cases.Now, code that in Python.The function would be:def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:    s_map = {}    t_map = {}    for sc, tc in zip(s, t):        if sc in s_map:            if s_map[sc] != tc:                return False        else:            if tc in t_map:                if t_map[tc] != sc:                    return False            else:                s_map[sc] = tc                t_map[tc] = sc    return TrueWait, but in Python, if the two strings are of different lengths, the zip would stop at the shorter one. But the note says that we can assume they have the same length. So the problem constraints ensure that.But to be safe, maybe the code should first check len(s) == len(t). But the note says we may assume that. So no need.So this code should work.Testing example 2: s = \\"foo\\", t = \\"bar\\".First pair f→b added. Second pair o→a added. Third pair o: check s_map[o] is a, which doesn't match t_char 'r' → return False.

The problem is to find the sum of the lengths of all the \\"good\\" strings in the given words array. A good string is one that can be formed using the characters from chars, with each character used only once. So, for each word in words, I need to check if it can be formed from the characters in chars. If yes, then add its length to the total sum.Hmm, how to approach this? Well, the first thing that comes to mind is to count the frequency of each character in the chars string. Then, for each word, count its characters and compare with the chars' counts. If for all characters in the word, the count in the word is less than or equal to the count in chars, then it's a good word.Right. So steps could be:1. Create a frequency dictionary for chars. Like, for each character in chars, how many times it appears. Maybe using a Counter from the collections module in Python.2. For each word in words, create a frequency dictionary as well.3. Compare the two counters. For each character in the word's counter, check if it exists in the chars' counter and that the count is sufficient.If all characters in the word meet this condition, then the word is good. Sum its length.So, in code terms:- First, create the chars_counter = Counter(chars)Then, for each word in words:- word_counter = Counter(word)- Check for every key in word_counter:   if chars_counter.get(key, 0) >= word_counter[key]   if any key fails, then the word is not good.- If all pass, add len(word) to the total sum.Yes. That seems solid.But wait, what about the efficiency? Since words can be up to 1000 in length, and each word can be up to 100 characters. Each word's processing would involve creating a Counter (which is O(k) where k is the length of the word), and then checking each character in that Counter. But given the constraints, this is manageable. 1000 * 100 is 1e5 operations, which should be okay.So code-wise, in Python:Import Counter from collections.The function would be:def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:    total = 0    chars_counter = Counter(chars)    for word in words:        word_counter = Counter(word)        for c, cnt in word_counter.items():            if chars_counter.get(c, 0) < cnt:                break        else:            total += len(word)    return totalWait, the else clause here is for the for loop. So if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., all characters in word have sufficient counts in chars), then the else is executed, adding the length.Yes, that should work.Let me test with the examples.Example 1:words = [\\"cat\\",\\"bt\\",\\"hat\\",\\"tree\\"], chars = \\"atach\\"chars_counter would be {'a':2, 't':1, 'c':1, 'h':1}?Wait, let's see. chars is \\"atach\\" — letters are a, t, a, c, h. So a appears 2 times, others once.So for the word \\"cat\\":c:1, a:1, t:1. Check each in chars_counter. a's count is 2 >=1, c 1 >=1, t 1 >=1. So good. Add 3.bt: b is not in chars_counter? So chars_counter.get('b',0) is 0, which is less than 1. So break, not added.hat: h:1, a:1, t:1. All are present. h is 1, a is 2 >=1. So add 3.tree: t is 1, r is not in chars. So no. Total 3+3=6. Correct.Example 2:words = [\\"hello\\",\\"world\\",\\"leetcode\\"], chars = \\"welldonehoneyr\\"chars_counter would have w, e, l, d, o, n, h, y, r, etc. Let's see.\\"hello\\" needs h (1), e (1), l (2), o (1). Check:chars_counter for h:1? Let's see. The chars string is \\"welldonehoneyr\\".Breaking it down:w, e, l, l, d, o, n, e, h, o, n, e, y, r.So chars_counter for e:3, l:2, o:2, h:1, etc.So for 'hello' word_counter:h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1. Check:h is 1 >=1, e 3 >=1, l 2 >=2, o 2 >=1. So yes. So add 5.'world' word_counter: w, o, r, l, d. Each once.Check if chars_counter has w:1, o:2 >=1, r:1, l:2 >=1, d:1. All yes. So add 5. Total 10.'leetcode' has l, e, e, t, c, o, d, e. So e count is 3 in the word. But in chars, e is 3. So possible. But wait, the chars may not have t or c. Let's check the chars given. The example says the chars is \\"welldonehoneyr\\". Let's see: letters present are w, e, l, l, d, o, n, e, h, o, n, e, y, r. So no 't' or 'c' in chars. So 'leetcode' has 't' and 'c' which are not present. So it's invalid. So the total is 5+5=10, which matches the example.So the code works for these cases.What about edge cases? Like when chars has exactly the required letters. Or when a word has a character not in chars at all.Another test case: word is \\"a\\", chars is \\"a\\". Then the sum is 1.What if the same character is used multiple times. Like word is \\"aaa\\", chars has \\"aa\\". Then chars_counter has 'a':2. The word's 'a's count is 3. So 2 <3, so not added.What about a word that's empty? But according to the note, words[i].length >=1.

Because the ones not in the correct sequence can be rearranged to fit. Wait, no. Because the correct order is the sorted array. So the number of students not in the correct position in the sorted array is the answer.Wait, let me think again. Let's take the first example. The sorted array is the target. The students that are already in the correct positions (matching the sorted array) can stay. The ones that are not in the correct positions must move, regardless of their order. Because even if some of them are in a non-decreasing order among themselves, but their positions don't match the sorted array, they need to be moved. Because the problem requires the students to be in the non-decreasing order as per the sorted array. So the answer is the number of positions where the original array and the sorted array differ.So the solution is to sort the array, compare each element with the original, and count the differences. That's straightforward.Wait, let's check example 2. Input is [5,1,2,3,4]. The sorted array would be [1,2,3,4,5]. Comparing each position, original is 5 vs 1: different. 1 vs 2: different. 2 vs 3: different. 3 vs4: different. 4 vs5: different. So all 5 elements are different. So the answer is 5, which matches the example.Third example: the input is already sorted, so all positions match. So the answer is 0.So the approach is to sort the array, then compare each element with the original, and count the number of mismatches. That's it.Wait, but why does that work? Because in order to get the array sorted, those elements that are already in the correct position can stay. The others must be moved, even if they are in the right order but in the wrong place. Because the correct positions are exactly the sorted array. So the answer is simply the number of positions where the original and sorted arrays differ.So the code would be straightforward. Let's think about how to implement this.First, we create a sorted version of the heights array. Then, compare each element in the original and sorted arrays. For each index where they differ, increment the count. Return the count.So in Python, the function would look like:def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:    sorted_heights = sorted(heights)    count = 0    for h, s_h in zip(heights, sorted_heights):        if h != s_h:            count +=1    return countYes, that should do it. Let me test this against the examples.Example 1: original and sorted arrays. The differences are at indices 2,4,5. So count is 3. Correct.Example 2: all elements differ. So count is 5. Correct.Example 3: no differences. Count is 0.So this approach works. The code seems simple, but perhaps there's a catch. Let's think about possible edge cases.Edge case: all elements the same. For example, [1,1,1]. The sorted array is same as original. So count is 0. Correct.Another case: [2,1]. Sorted is [1,2]. Both positions differ. So count is 2, which is correct because both need to move. Wait, but if you move both, they can swap. So the answer is 2. So the code returns 2, which is correct.Another case: [1,3,2]. Sorted is [1,2,3]. Compare: index 1 (3 vs2), index 2 (2 vs3). So count is 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct because those two need to be moved. Even if they can swap among themselves, they are not in the correct positions. So moving them is required.Yes, the code works. So the solution is to count the differences between the original array and the sorted array.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of students that must move so that all students stand in non-decreasing order of their heights. The key insight is to compare the original array with its sorted version and count the mismatches, as each mismatch indicates a student who needs to move. Approach1. Sort the Array: First, we sort the given array of heights. This sorted array represents the target arrangement where all students are in non-decreasing order.2. Compare Elements: Next, we compare each element of the original array with the corresponding element in the sorted array.

The total sum thus gives the count of students who need to move.This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of moves required by leveraging sorting and a linear comparison, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of students."},{"problem":"Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.Example:Input:[1,2,3]Output:3Explanation:Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to make all elements in a non-empty integer array equal. A move is defined as incrementing n-1 elements by 1 each. Hmm, so each move we leave one element as is and increase the rest. But wait, how does this add up over multiple moves? Let's think through the example given.The example input is [1,2,3]. The output is 3. The steps they took were incrementing two elements each time. Let's see:First move: [2,3,3] → increments 1 and 2, leaving 3 as is. Second move: [3,4,3] → increments 3 and 3 (so the second and third elements?), leading to third element as 3, then third move makes them all 4. Wait, maybe there's another way to look at it. Oh right, each time you increment n-1 elements. For n=3, that's two elements each move.Wait, the key here is to find out the minimal number of steps. Let's think about what happens when we do this. Each move increases n-1 elements by 1. So, effectively, each move increases the total sum of the array by (n-1)*1. Because you add 1 to n-1 elements each time.But the goal is to make all elements equal. Let's say the final value is x. Then, each element will be x. The total sum of the array after all moves would be n * x. The original sum is S. Each move adds (n-1) to S. Let's say there are m moves. Then, the total sum after m moves is S + m*(n-1) = n * x. So, solving for m: m = (n*x - S) / (n-1).But we need another equation here. What's x in terms of the original array? Well, the minimal number of moves is required. Let's think differently. Let's consider that in each move, all elements except one are increased by 1. So, the element that is not increased in a move is effectively lagging behind by 1 compared to the others. Wait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe we can model this as how much each element needs to be increased. Let's say the final value is x. Then, for each element a_i in the original array, the number of times it was not incremented in a move is (x - a_i). Because each time we didn't increment it, that element stayed at a_i plus the number of times it was incremented. Wait, maybe this is the right approach.Wait, each move, exactly one element is not incremented. So, over m moves, each element can be not incremented a certain number of times. Let's say that for element a_i, it was not incremented k_i times. Then, the total increments that element gets is m - k_i (since each of the m moves, if it was incremented in the move, it gets +1). So, the final value of a_i is a_i + (m - k_i) = x. Rearranging, k_i = a_i + m - x. But wait, since k_i is the number of times the element was not incremented, and each move has exactly one element not incremented, the sum of all k_i across all elements must be equal to m. Because each move contributes 1 to the sum of k_i. So sum(k_i for all i) = m.So, substituting k_i from the previous equation:sum( a_i + m - x ) = msum(a_i) + n*m - x*n = mSum(a_i) + m(n-1) = x * nWait, this is the same as earlier equation where S + m(n-1) = x *n. So that's consistent. So, this gives the same equation. But how to find x and m here? We have two variables. But perhaps we can express m in terms of the original array.Alternatively, let's think about the minimum element. Let's suppose the minimum element in the array is min_val. All elements need to reach x. The minimum element would have been incremented in every move except for the times it was the one not incremented. Wait, but if we need to reach x, then for the minimum element, the number of times it was not incremented is x - min_val. Because each time it was not incremented, it's not getting the +1, so the total increments it gets is m - (x - min_val) = x - min_val. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.Wait, the final value for the minimum element is x. Let's say the original value is a. Then, the total increments it gets is m minus the number of times it was not incremented (k_a). So:a + (m - k_a) = xBut k_a is the number of times it was not incremented. So k_a = x - a - m + k_a? No, I'm getting confused here. Let me rephrase. For the minimum element, how many times was it not incremented? Suppose the array starts with elements, and after m moves, all are x. For the minimum element, which started at min_val, each time it was not incremented, it's lagging behind. Let's see: each move that it is not incremented, the other elements are incremented. So, if the minimum element is not incremented in k moves, then those k moves, all other elements are being incremented. So, after those k moves, the min element is min_val + (m - k) (since it was incremented in m -k moves). The other elements would have been incremented in all moves except the ones where they were the ones not incremented. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, let's think of the problem as the sum approach. The sum after m moves is S + m*(n-1) = n*x. But also, the final x must be equal to the initial minimum plus the number of times the minimum was not incremented. Because the minimum can only be not incremented when it's left out. Wait, perhaps the minimum element is the one that is not incremented in the maximum number of moves. Because every time you don't increment the minimum, it stays behind, but the other elements can be incremented. Alternatively, the number of moves required is determined by the differences between each element and the minimum.Wait, another approach: Let's consider that each move increases n-1 elements. Which is equivalent to saying that one element is not increased. So, the difference between the elements that are increased and the one that's not is that the others are +1. So, the problem is similar to, in each step, decreasing one element by 1 (since increasing others by 1 is like making that element effectively 1 less in comparison). Then, the problem becomes finding how many steps to make all elements equal by decrementing one element by 1 each step. Because the end result is the same as when you have to reduce all elements to the minimum value. Because, in this transformed problem, each step you can choose any element to decrement by 1, and the goal is to make all elements equal. The minimal number of steps would be the sum of the differences between each element and the minimum. Wait, that makes sense. Because in the original problem, each move effectively adds 1 to all elements except one. Let's see: suppose you have two elements, [a, b]. To make them equal, each move you can increment one of them. Let's say you need to reach [c, c]. Let's say a < b. Then, the difference between them is (b - a). Each move you can increase the smaller one by 1 (since you leave the larger one as is). So after (b - a) moves, they become equal. Alternatively, if you model it as decrementing the larger one by 1 each move, which would take (b -a) steps. So the sum of the differences is (b -a) in this case.So, for the array [1,2,3], the differences are 2 (from 3-1) and 1 (from 2-1). Sum is 3, which matches the example's output. So, the minimal number of moves is the sum of (each element - the minimum element).So, the solution is to compute the sum of all elements minus the minimum element multiplied by the number of elements.Wait, let's see: sum( (x_i - min_x) for all x_i )Yes, because the minimum element doesn't contribute to the sum (since x_i - min_x is zero for the min element), and the others contribute their difference. So the total sum of these differences is the required number of moves.So, the algorithm is:1. Find the minimum element in the array.2. Sum all elements, subtract (min_element * n) to get the total sum of differences.But wait, sum(x_i) - min * n = sum( x_i - min )Yes. So sum( x_i - min ) is the required moves.So, for example, [1,2,3], sum is 6. min is 1, n is 3. sum - min *n =6-3=3, which matches the example.Another example: [1,1,1]. Sum is 3. sum - 1*3=0. So zero moves needed, correct.Another example: [3,4,5]. Min is 3. sum is 12. sum -3*3=12-9=3. So three moves. Let's see:First move: leave 3, increment 4 and 5 to 5,6. Now array is [3,5,6].Second move: leave 3, increment 5 and 6 to 6,7. Now [3,6,7].Third move: leave 3, increment 6 and 7 to 7,8. Now [3,7,8]. Wait, this is not leading to equal elements. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, wait, maybe this approach is wrong.Wait, wait a second. Wait, in the original problem, each move increments n-1 elements. So for [3,4,5], the first move would be to increment all except one. Let's see: Let's say we choose to increment 3 and 4. Then after first move, they become 4,5,5. Then next move, increment 4 and 5 →5,6,5. Then increment 5 and 5 →6,6,6. So three moves. Which matches the sum approach. So the approach works here. But in the example I tried earlier, where I left 3 in each step, that's not allowed. Because each move you can leave only one element. So the correct way to reach the answer is to increment all elements except the minimum in each step. Wait, but how?Ah, right. Because in the sum approach, the minimum is the one that is never left. Wait, no. Maybe the key is that to minimize the number of moves, you always leave the largest element. So, for example, in each step, you increment all elements except the current maximum. That way, the maximum stays, and others catch up. But perhaps the approach where you increment all but one is equivalent, as long as the sum approach holds.Wait, but the sum approach gives the correct answer, regardless of which element is left each time. Because the sum of differences to the minimum gives the required steps. So perhaps this approach is valid.So the formula is sum(nums) - min(nums) * len(nums).So the function can be written as: compute the sum of all elements, subtract the minimum element multiplied by the length of the array.Let me test this with some examples.Another test case: [2,2,3]. Sum is 7. Min is 2. n=3. 7 - 2*3=1. So the answer should be 1.Let's see: [2,2,3]. After one move, increment two elements. Let's increment the first two. Then they become 3,3,3. Correct. So yes, one move.Another example: [5,6,7]. Sum is 18. Min 5. 18 -5*3=3. So three moves.First move: increment 5 and 6 →6,7,7. Second: increment 6 and7 →7,8,7. Third: increment 7 and8 →8,8,8. Wait, but that's three moves. Yes.Wait, but in each step, you could also leave the largest element. For example, first move, increment 5 and6 →6,7,7. Second, increment 5 and7 →7,7,8. Third, increment 7 and8 →8,8,8. Wait, that's three steps as well. So regardless of which elements are left each time, the sum approach gives the correct answer.Thus, the solution is to compute the sum of all elements, subtract the product of the minimum and the length of the array. The result is the minimal number of moves.So the code would be:def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:    return sum(nums) - min(nums) * len(nums)But wait, let's check if this works for all cases.Another test case: [1,3,5]. Sum is 9. min is 1. 9 -1*3 =6. So 6 moves.Let's see:Original array: [1,3,5]After each move:Move 1: increment all except 5 →2,4,5.Move 2: increment all except 5 →3,5,5.Move 3: increment all except5 →4,6,5.Move4: increment all except6 →5,6,6.Move5: increment all except6 →6,7,6.Move6: increment all except7 →7,7,7. So 6 moves. Correct.Yes, the formula works here.So this approach seems correct.Therefore, the Python function is as simple as summing the list, subtracting the minimum multiplied by the length.Thus, the code is straightforward.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to make all elements of a non-empty integer array equal, where each move consists of incrementing ( n-1 ) elements by 1.

However, instead of incrementing ( n-1 ) elements, we can reframe the problem by considering the relative differences between elements.

This approach is equivalent to decrementing the maximum element by 1 in each move until all elements become equal.

Because if I take 1, 2, or 3 stones, the friend can take the remaining and win. So if there's 4 stones, the first player can't win.Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see other examples.If n is 1, 2, 3: I take all and win. So output is true.n=4: lose.What about n=5? If I take 1 stone, leaving 4. Then the friend is in the losing position. So I can win. So output true.n=5: yes. n=6: take 2, leave 4. Friend loses. So true. n=7: take 3, leave 4. So true. n=8: if I take 1,2,3 stones, friend can take 3,2,1 respectively, leaving 4, which makes me lose. So for n=8, output is false.Wait a minute, the pattern seems to be that whenever n is a multiple of 4, the first player can't win. Because whatever the first player takes (k stones), the second can take 4 - k, bringing the total removed per round to 4. So the second player can force the game into the next multiple of 4. Eventually, when there are 4 left, the first player is forced to leave 1-3 stones, which the second takes and wins.So the general rule is: if the initial number of stones is not divisible by 4, the first player can win. Otherwise, they lose.So the function should return (n % 4) != 0.Wait, but let's test this.n=4 → 4%4=0 → return false. Correct.n=5 → 5%4=1 → true. Correct.n=8 → returns false. Correct.n=7 → 7%4=3 → true. Correct.So the code is straightforward. The function can be written as return n %4 !=0.But wait, what if n is zero?

If yes, return True (can win), else False.So in code:class Solution:    def canWinNim(self, n: int) -> bool:        return n % 4 != 0Yes, that's it. Because when n is not a multiple of 4, the first player can always take enough stones to leave a multiple of 4 for the opponent, thereby forcing them into a losing position. And if it's a multiple of 4, whatever the first player does, the opponent can adjust to bring it back to a multiple of 4.So the solution is simply checking if n mod 4 is not zero.

Since there are N+1 unique elements, and one element is repeated N times, the rest are unique. So the repeated element is the one that appears N times.Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The straightforward way would be to count the occurrences of each element and find the one that appears N times. But since N is half the length of the array, which is 2N, so N is (length of array)/2. For example, in example 1, the array is length 4, so N is 2, and the element 3 appears twice. So the target is the element that appears exactly N times.Wait, but how to compute N? Well, since the array's length is 2N, so N is len(A)//2. So for an array of even length (as per the note), N is len(A)//2.So the steps could be:1. Count the frequency of each element in the array.2. Find which element has a frequency equal to len(A)//2.3. Return that element.But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Because the array has N+1 unique elements. So except for the one that's repeated N times, all others are unique. That implies that the repeated element must appear at least twice. Wait, but the problem states that exactly one element is repeated N times. So in the array, that element occurs N times, and the others once each.So for example, in the third example, the array has 8 elements. N is 4. The element 5 occurs 4 times, others occur once each. So total unique elements are 5 (N+1=4+1=5? Wait 8 elements, N is 4. N+1 is 5 unique elements. So yes, 5 unique elements in that case: 5,1,2,3,4.So the count for each element is either 1 or N. So the element we are looking for is the one with count N.So the approach is to count the occurrences and return the one with count N.But how to implement this efficiently.In Python, I can use a dictionary to count. Like:from collections import Counterdef repeatedNTimes(A):    count = Counter(A)    n = len(A) // 2    for key, val in count.items():        if val == n:            return keyBut wait, what about the time complexity? For the constraints given, the array can be up to 10,000 elements. So even if we loop through all the elements, it's manageable. The Counter will handle it.But maybe there's a way to optimize. Since the array has exactly one element that occurs N times, and others occur once. So the maximum possible count is N, and there's only one such element.But even with the straightforward approach, it's O(n) time and O(n) space. Which should be acceptable.Wait, but maybe we can find the answer without using extra space. Let's think: since the array has 2N elements, and the repeated element occurs N times, which is half the array. So if any element appears more than once in the first few positions, it's a candidate.Alternatively, since the array has N+1 unique elements, and the rest are duplicates of the one element, then the duplicates must be adjacent or spaced in some way. But this might not hold. So perhaps looking for duplicates in consecutive elements, or within a certain window.Another approach: The repeated element must appear at least once in every window of a certain size. For example, considering that there are 2N elements, and the element appears N times. So in the worst case, the elements are arranged as [x, a, x, b, x, c, ...], but that's not possible because N is len(A)//2. For example, if the array is length 4 (N=2), the element x must appear twice. So possible arrangements are like [x, x, a, b], [x, a, x, b], etc.So perhaps checking for duplicates in consecutive triplets. Because if the array is arranged such that x is spread out, but since x occurs N times, which is half the array, it's guaranteed that at least two x's are within some proximity. For example, in an array of length 4, x appears twice. They can be adjacent or not. If not adjacent, then the elements are like x a x b. So the distance between the two x's is two elements apart. For larger arrays, perhaps the maximum distance between two x's is such that there exists a window of 3 elements where two are x's.Alternatively, if the array has N+1 unique elements, then by the pigeonhole principle, when considering the first N+2 elements, there must be a duplicate. Wait, maybe not. Let's see: For example, N=2, array size is 4. N+1=3 unique elements. So first 3 elements could be all unique, but then the fourth has to be one of them, which is the duplicate. So perhaps, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe check adjacent elements. If any two consecutive elements are the same, then that's the answer. Because if there are two same elements in a row, they must be part of the N occurrences. But wait, what if the duplicate elements are not consecutive. For example, [1,2,1,3]. Here, 1 is the answer. But the two 1's are not consecutive. So checking consecutive elements would miss it.Hmm. So that approach might not work.Alternatively, check all pairs of elements that are at most k apart, and find the duplicate. But how to choose k.Alternatively, since the element appears N times, which is half of the array, then in any window of 4 elements, there must be a duplicate. Let's think: if the element occurs N times, and the array length is 2N. So for example, N=2, array length 4. The element occurs twice. So in any four elements, it's the entire array, so there are two occurrences. So in this case, there must be at least two elements, but they could be spread out. For example, [x, a, x, b], the two x's are two positions apart. So in any window of three elements, there is at most one x. So a window of three elements may not capture duplicates.Wait, perhaps a different approach. Since the array has N+1 unique elements, and exactly one element is duplicated N times. So all other elements are unique. So the duplicated element must be the only one that appears more than once. So if we can find an element that appears more than once in the array, that's the answer.Wait, because all others appear once. So the first element that appears twice is the answer.So for example, in [1,2,3,3], 3 appears twice, others once. So once we find the first duplicate, we can return it.But how to check for duplicates. So the first occurrence of a duplicate in the array is the desired element.But how to do that efficiently. For example, using a set, and as we iterate through the array, check if the current element is already in the set. If yes, return it. Otherwise, add to the set.Wait, but what if the array is arranged such that the duplicated element's first occurrence is at the beginning, and the next occurrence is much later. Like [x, a, b, c, x, ...]. Then this approach would return x when the second x is found.But in this case, this approach works. Because the first duplicate found is the correct element.Yes, because the problem states that there's exactly one element that is duplicated N times, and all others are unique. So the first time we find a duplicate, it must be the required element.Because all other elements are unique. So, for example, in the array [2,1,2,5,3,2], the first occurrence of 2 is index 0. The next occurrence is index 2, which is the first duplicate found. So return 2.In example 3, [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4], the first occurrence of 5 is index 0. The next occurrence is index 2, so return 5.In example 1, [1,2,3,3], 3 is first duplicate found at index 3. So return 3.So this approach works.So the algorithm is: Iterate through the array, keep a set of seen elements. For each element, if it's already in the set, return it. Otherwise, add to the set. This would find the first duplicate and return it. Since all other elements are unique, the first duplicate found must be the required element.This is O(n) time and O(n) space. But in the worst case, if the array's duplicated element is only found at the last element, then we have to iterate through all elements. But in practice, since the duplicated element occurs N times (which is at least 2, since array length is at least 4), then there must be at least two occurrences. So the first duplicate must be found early.For example, in the worst case scenario where the duplicated element is first and last. Like [x, a, b, x]. Then when the first x is added to the set, the second x is encountered at index 3. So the code would return x.Yes.But wait, what if the duplicated element's first occurrence is not the first element. For example, [a, x, b, x]. Then when x is added to the set at index 1. Then when x is encountered again at index 3, the code returns x. So correct.So this approach works. Because the first duplicate encountered must be the element that is duplicated N times. Because all other elements are unique, so their first occurrence would not have duplicates again.So this is a O(n) time and O(n) space solution, but with better constants than the Counter approach, as we can return as soon as we find the first duplicate.So the code would be something like:def repeatedNTimes(A):    seen = set()    for num in A:        if num in seen:            return num        seen.add(num)Wait, but wait. What if the array has elements where a non-target element is duplicated? But according to the problem statement, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one element is repeated N times. All other elements are unique, so no other duplicates. So the only element that is duplicated is the target. So the code is correct.Therefore, this approach works and is more efficient than counting all elements. So this is the optimal solution.But let's test with the examples.Example 1: [1,2,3,3]. The code checks 1 (not in set), add. 2 (not in set), add. 3 (not in set), add. Then next element is 3, which is in set, return 3. Correct.Example 2: [2,1,2,5,3,2]. The first 2 is added. Then 1 added. Then 2 is found in set, return 2. Correct.Example 3: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]. The first 5 is added. Then 1 added. Next 5 is found in set, return 5. Correct.So all examples pass. So this code works.Therefore, the solution is to iterate through the array, track seen elements in a set, return the first duplicate encountered.So the Python code would be as described.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to identify the element that is repeated exactly N times in an array of size 2N, where there are N+1 unique elements. The key insight is that the repeated element must appear more than once, and all other elements are unique. This allows us to efficiently find the repeated element by tracking seen elements and returning the first duplicate encountered. Approach1. Tracking Seen Elements: Use a set to keep track of elements as we iterate through the array.2. Early Termination: As soon as we encounter an element that has already been seen, we return that element immediately. This works because the problem guarantees exactly one element is repeated, and all others are unique.This approach ensures that we find the solution in linear time (O(n)) and linear space (O(n)), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is due to the set used to track seen elements, which in the worst case will store all elements except the repeated one.

This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails?  Example 1:Input: [\\"test.email+alex@leetcode.com\\",\\"test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com\\",\\"testemail+david@lee.tcode.com\\"]Output: 2Explanation: \\"testemail@leetcode.com\\" and \\"testemail@lee.tcode.com\\" actually receive mails Note:1 <= emails[i].length <= 1001 <= emails.length <= 100Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character.All local and domain names are non-empty.Local names do not start with a '+' character.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have a list of emails, and I need to find out how many unique email addresses actually receive mails after applying some rules. Hmm.So the rules are: For the local name (the part before the @), periods don't matter. So like, \\"alice.z\\" becomes \\"alicez\\" when the email is processed. Also, anything after a plus sign in the local name is ignored. So \\"my+name\\" becomes \\"my\\". But the domain name (after the @) stays the same, except that the rules don't apply there. So the domain is left as is.So for each email, I need to process the local part according to these rules, then combine it with the domain part, and then count the unique ones.First, how to split the email into local and domain parts. Oh right, split on the @. Each email has exactly one @, so that's easy. So for each email in the list, split into two parts at the @.Then process the local part: remove any dots, and ignore everything after the first plus.So the steps for the local part would be:1. Split the local part into the part before the first plus and the rest. So like, \\"test.email+alex\\" becomes \\"test.email\\" and then we take that part before the plus.Wait, no. The plus can be anywhere in the local part. So for the local name, after splitting, we take everything before the first '+' and then remove all the dots from that.So, for example, \\"test.email+alex\\" becomes \\"testemail\\" (after removing dots from the part before the plus).Then combine that with the domain part, which is unchanged.So the overall processing for each email is:split into local and domain.process local:- split on '+', take the first part.- remove all '.' from that part.then combine processed local + '@' + domain.Once all emails are processed like that, collect all the resulting addresses and count the unique ones.So for the example given:[\\"test.email+alex@leetcode.com\\",\\"test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com\\",\\"testemail+david@lee.tcode.com\\"]Processing each:First email:local is \\"test.email+alex\\" → split into \\"test.email\\" and \\"alex\\". Take \\"test.email\\", remove dots → \\"testemail\\", combine with domain → \\"testemail@leetcode.com\\"Second email:local is \\"test.e.mail+bob.cathy\\" → split into \\"test.e.mail\\", process to remove dots → \\"testemail\\". So same as first, domain is same, so same address.Third email:local is \\"testemail+david\\" → split into \\"testemail\\", process (no dots) → \\"testemail\\", domain is lee.tcode.com → \\"testemail@lee.tcode.com\\".So total unique addresses are 2, which matches the example.So the approach is to process each email as per the rules, then use a set to track unique addresses.Now, how to implement this in Python.First, for each email in the input list:split into local and domain parts. How? Using split('@'). That will split into two parts. Then, process the local part.For the local processing:- Split the local part on '+', take the first part. For example, local.split('+')[0]Then, remove all '.' from that string. So replace '.' with empty string.Then, the processed email is (processed_local) + '@' + domain.Once all emails are processed, add each to a set, then return the length of the set.Yes. So the code steps would be:Initialize a set.For each email in emails:   split into local, domain = email.split('@')   process local:       local_part = local.split('+', 1)[0]  # split once, take first part       processed_local = local_part.replace('.', '')   processed_email = processed_local + '@' + domain   add to the set.Return the size of the set.That seems straightforward.Edge cases to consider:What if there's no '+' in the local part? Then split returns the entire local, then just remove dots.What if the local has multiple '+'? Split on the first one, so everything after is ignored.What about the domain part having '+' or '.'? Those are left as is. The rules don't apply to the domain.So the code should handle that.Testing the example:Let's take first email: \\"test.email+alex@leetcode.com\\"split into local = \\"test.email+alex\\", domain = \\"leetcode.com\\"split local on '+' → [\\"test.email\\", \\"alex\\"], take first → \\"test.email\\"replace '.' → \\"testemail\\"so processed email is testemail@leetcode.com.Second email: \\"test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com\\"split into local \\"test.e.mail+bob.cathy\\"split on '+' → \\"test.e.mail\\"replace '.' → \\"testemail\\" → same as first.Third email: \\"testemail+david@lee.tcode.com\\"split into local \\"testemail+david\\" → take \\"testemail\\", no dots → same as domain.So the code should process those correctly.Another test case: \\"a.b.c+def@example.com\\" → processed as \\"abc@example.com\\".Another case: \\"a+@example.com\\" → local is a+, split into 'a', then process → 'a' → \\"a@example.com\\".What about a local with no '+' and no dots? Then it stays as is.So the code should handle all these cases.So the Python function would be:def numUniqueEmails(self, emails: List[str]) -> int:    unique_emails = set()    for email in emails:        local, domain = email.split('@')        processed_local = local.split('+', 1)[0].replace('.', '')        unique_emails.add(processed_local + '@' + domain)    return len(unique_emails)Yes, that should work. Let me check for possible errors.Wait, the split('@') could return more than two parts if there's multiple @, but according to the problem statement, each email has exactly one @, so split into two parts. So no problem.Also, the note says that local names do not start with '+', so when splitting on '+', the first part can't be empty.So the code should handle all cases as per the problem constraints.So that's the solution.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many unique email addresses actually receive mails after applying specific processing rules to each email's local part.

Note:n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).Example 1:Input:3Output:3Example 2:Input:11Output:0Explanation:The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. I need to find the nth digit in the infinite sequence formed by concatenating all the integers starting from 1. Hmm, how to approach this?So the examples given: for n=3, it's 3. For n=11, the output is 0, which comes from the number 10. Right, so the sequence is 1,2,3,...9, then 10, 11, etc. The digits are 123456789101112... So the 11th is the 0 in 10.The key here is to find out which number the nth digit comes from and then extract the correct digit from that number. But how?I remember that the numbers are grouped by their digit lengths. Like 1-digit numbers (1-9), 2-digits (10-99), 3-digits (100-999), and so on. Each group contributes a certain number of digits. So maybe the approach is to find out which group the nth digit falls into, then find the exact number and the digit within it.Let's break it down step by step.First, find out how many digits the numbers in each group have. The first group has 9 numbers (1-9) each with 1 digit. The second group has 90 numbers (10-99), each with 2 digits. The third group has 900 numbers (100-999), 3 digits each, etc. So for group k (starting from 1), the number of digits contributed is 9 * 10^(k-1) * k.So the plan is to subtract the digits contributed by each group until we find the group where the nth digit is located.For example, let's take n=11.Start with group 1 (digits=1). The total digits here are 9*1=9. Since 11>9, subtract 9 and move to the next group. Now n=2, group is 2 (digits=2). The total here is 90*2=180. Since 2 < 180, we are in this group.Then, we need to find which number in this group contains the nth digit. Since each number in this group has 2 digits, the number of numbers needed is (n-1) // digits. Wait, maybe after subtracting previous groups, the remaining n is the position in the current group.Wait, let's formalize this:Initialize variables:- digits = 1 (current number of digits in the group)- count = 9 (the count of numbers in the current group)- start = 1 (the starting number of the current group)Loop:Subtract the total digits of the current group (count * digits) from n. If after subtraction n becomes <=0, break out. Otherwise, move to the next group: digits increases by 1, count *=10, start *=10.Once we find the right group, calculate which number in the group it is. The remaining n (after subtracting previous groups) is used here.The position within the group is (n-1) // digits, because each number contributes 'digits' digits. Then, the actual number is start + (position). Then, the digit is the (n-1 % digits)th digit of that number.Let's test this with example 2: n=11.Initial n=11.First group: digits=1, count=9. 9*1=9. 11-9=2, which is positive. So proceed. digits becomes 2, count=90, start=10.Now, in the next group, the digits per number is 2. The total digits here are 90*2=180. Now, current n is 2. Since 2 <= 180, we stay here.Now, find which number in this group: (n-1)//digits = (2-1)/2 = 0.5? Wait, no, integer division. So (2-1) is 1, divided by 2 is 0. So the number is start + 0 =10. Then the digit is (1 % 2)th position in 10. Wait, 10 has digits '1' and '0'. The index here: n was 2. After subtracting 9, n is 2. (n-1) gives 1, mod digits (2) gives 1. So the second digit (index 1) is '0', which matches the example.Yes, that works.Another example: n=3. It's in the first group. start=1, digits=1. (3-1)//1 = 2, so number is 1+2=3. Then (3-1) mod 1 =2 mod1=0. So the first digit of 3 is 3. Correct.So the steps are:1. Subtract the digits from each group until the remaining n is within the current group's digits.2. Find the exact number in the group.3. Find the exact digit in that number.Now, implementing this in code.Let me think about the variables:Initialize digits=1, count=9, start=1.Loop while n > digits * count:    subtract digits * count from n.    digits +=1    count *=10    start *=10Once out of loop, the number is start + (n-1) // digits.Then, the digit index is (n-1) % digits.Convert the number to string, take the digit at that index, return as integer.Yes.So code steps:def findNthDigit(self, n: int) -> int:    digits = 1    count = 9    start = 1    while n > digits * count:        n -= digits * count        digits +=1        count *=10        start *=10    # Now find the number    number = start + (n-1) // digits    # find the digit in the number    return int(str(number)[(n-1) % digits])Wait, but wait: let's test with n=10. Let's see.n=10:First group: digits=1, count=9. 10>9, so subtract 9, n becomes 1.digits becomes 2, count=90, start=10.Now, check if n (1) > 2*90? No. So proceed.number is 10 + (1-1)//2 =10 +0=10.digit index (1-1) %2=0. So the first digit of 10 is '1'. But wait, the 10th digit is 1?Wait, the sequence up to 9 is 9 digits. Then the 10th is the first digit of 10, which is '1'. But according to the sample input 11, which is the 11th digit (the second digit of 10 is 0).Wait for n=10, the output should be 1. Let's see:Yes. So according to the code, for n=10:After first iteration, n=1, digits=2, start=10.number =10 + (1-1)/2=10 +0=10.digit index is 0: '1' from '10'. So code returns 1.Which is correct.So the code seems to handle that.Another test: n=11.After first iteration, n=2. digits=2, start=10.number =10 + (2-1)//2 =10 +0 (since (1)//2=0.5 becomes 0 in integer division). So 10 +0=10.digit index is (2-1) %2=1%2=1. The second digit of '10' is '0'. Correct.Yes.So the code seems to handle the cases.Now, what about very large n? But the note says n is within 32-bit integer, so the code should handle that.Potential edge case: n=1, returns 1. n=9, returns 9. n=10 returns 1. n=190 (the first digit of 100? Let's see.Let's compute for digits=2: 9*1=9. 90*2=180. So total digits up to 99 is 9+180=189. Then n=190 is the first digit of 100.Yes. Let's see code:digits starts at 1, count=9. 190>9? Yes. subtract 9, n=181. digits becomes 2, count=90. 181> 2*90=180. So subtract 180, n=1. digits becomes 3, count=900, start=100. Now, check if n>3*900? No. So number is 100 + (1-1)/3=100. digit index (0) mod3=0. So the first digit of 100 is 1. So n=190 returns 1. Correct.Yes.So the code should handle all cases.So the code is:class Solution:    def findNthDigit(self, n: int) -> int:        digits = 1        count = 9        start = 1        while n > digits * count:            n -= digits * count            digits += 1            count *= 10            start *= 10        number = start + (n - 1) // digits        return int(str(number)[(n - 1) % digits])","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the nth digit in an infinite sequence formed by concatenating all positive integers starting from 1.

But 8 has elements in arr2 that are within 2 (like 9, which is 1 away, and 8 itself). So 8 doesn't count. So the total is 2.So the approach is: for each element in arr1, check all elements in arr2. If none of them are within or equal to d, then increment the count.But how to do this efficiently? Because if the arrays are large (up to 500 elements each), a brute-force approach would be O(n*m) where n and m are lengths of arr1 and arr2. For 500 each, that's 250,000 operations. That's acceptable, right? Since 500 is not that big. So maybe a straightforward approach would work here.Wait, but maybe we can optimize. Let's think. For each element in arr1, say x, we need to check if there's any element y in arr2 such that |x - y| <= d. If even one exists, x is excluded from the count. So, the count is the number of x in arr1 where all y in arr2 are such that |x - y| > d.So the straightforward approach is:Initialize a count to 0.Loop through each element x in arr1:   For each element y in arr2:       compute absolute difference. If any difference <=d, mark x as invalid and break.   If none of the y's in arr2 meet the condition, increment count.Return the count.Yes, that's the direct approach. But for each x in arr1, we have to check all elements in arr2. But with 500x500 = 250k operations, which is manageable.But wait, maybe we can sort arr2 and then for each x, find the closest elements in arr2, and check if the closest is within d. That could reduce the per-x check time from O(m) to O(log m) using binary search.How does that work? Let's think. If arr2 is sorted, then for a given x, the closest elements are around the insertion point of x in arr2. So we can find the position where x would be inserted, then check the elements before and after (if they exist) to find the minimal difference. If the minimal difference is <=d, then x is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.Yes, that's a better approach. Sorting arr2 once would take O(m log m) time, but then for each x in arr1, the check becomes O(log m) time. So the total time would be O(m log m + n log m). Since m can be up to 500, m log m is about 500*9=4500, and n log m is 500*9=4500. So total 9k operations, which is way better than 250k.So this approach would be more efficient, especially for larger m and n.So the steps would be:1. Sort the arr2 array.2. For each x in arr1:   a. Use binary search to find the insertion position in the sorted arr2.   b. Check the elements at the insertion position and the one before (if exists) to see if any of them are within d of x.   c. If any of these two elements is within d, then x is invalid. Otherwise, check if any elements in the rest of arr2 (but wait, since arr2 is sorted, the closest elements are adjacent to the insertion point. So the minimal difference must be with either the element before the insertion point or the element at the insertion point. For example, if x is inserted between elements arr2[i-1] and arr2[i], then the closest elements are arr2[i-1] and arr2[i]. So checking these two is sufficient to find the minimal difference. Therefore, if the minimal difference is greater than d, then all elements in arr2 are more than d away from x. Because any element before i-1 is smaller than arr2[i-1], so x - arr2[i-1] is the largest possible (since array is sorted). Similarly, elements after i are larger than x, so arr2[i] -x is the smallest possible. Wait, maybe I need to think again.Let me clarify. Suppose arr2 is sorted. For x, the elements in arr2 can be split into two parts: those <=x and those >x. The insertion point i is where x would be inserted. So the elements at positions i-1 and i (if they exist) are the ones closest to x.For example, if x is 5 and arr2 is [3,6,7], then insertion point is 1 (after 3, before 6). The closest elements are 3 (i-1=0) and 6 (i=1). The minimal difference is min(5-3, 6-5) = 2 and 1. So the minimal is 1. So if d is >=1, then x is invalid.So by checking these two elements, we can find the minimal possible difference. If even the minimal is >d, then all elements are >d away. Otherwise, there exists an element within d.So the algorithm would be:Sort arr2.For each x in arr1:   Find the insertion index i in sorted arr2.   Check if any of the elements at i-1, i, or i+1 (no, probably not) are within d.Wait, but insertion index is where x would be placed. So the elements before i are <=x, elements from i onwards are >x. So the closest elements are at i-1 and i (if i is within the array bounds).So for x, we check elements at i-1 and i (if they exist). For example:If insertion index is 0 (x is less than all elements), then check only element at 0 (i=0, so element 0 is the first element >x). So closest is element 0, which is larger than x. So x - (element at i-1) is not possible (since i-1 is -1). So check element 0.If insertion index is m (x is larger than all elements), then check element m-1 (the last element).So the steps would be:For x:   Find i = bisect.bisect_left(arr2_sorted, x)   Then check arr2_sorted[i-1] if i>0.   Check arr2_sorted[i] if i < len(arr2_sorted).   Compute the absolute differences for these elements (if they exist) and see if any is <=d.   If any of them is, then x is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.Wait, but perhaps there's a scenario where the closest element is not adjacent to the insertion point. No, because the array is sorted. For example, arr2_sorted is [1,3,5,7], x is 4. Insertion point is 2 (since 4 would be inserted between 3 and 5). The closest elements are 3 (i-1=1) and 5 (i=2). The differences are 1 and 1. So indeed, the minimal difference is between these two.But if x is 6, then insertion point is 3 (since 5 and 7). The closest elements are 5 (i-1=2) and 7 (i=3). So checking those two.Thus, the approach is correct: check the elements around the insertion point. Because the array is sorted, the minimal difference must be with the element before or after the insertion point.So for each x in arr1:   Find the insertion index i in sorted arr2.   Check the elements at i-1 and i (if they exist).   If any of these elements' absolute difference with x is <=d, then x is invalid.   Else, x is valid.This reduces the number of checks per x from m to at most 2.Therefore, the steps are:Sort arr2.For each x in arr1:   Check if there exists any element in arr2 where |x - y| <=d. If not, increment count.But how to efficiently check this? By using the sorted arr2 and binary search.So code steps:First, sort arr2.Then, for each x in arr1:   left = 0, right = len(arr2) -1   use binary search to find the insertion index.   or use the bisect module.In Python, we can use bisect.bisect_left to get the insertion index.Then, for the elements around i, check.So code:sorted_arr2 = sorted(arr2)count = 0for x in arr1:    i = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_arr2, x)    valid = True    # check left neighbor (i-1)    if i > 0 and abs(x - sorted_arr2[i-1]) <=d:        valid = False    # check right neighbor (i)    elif i < len(sorted_arr2) and abs(x - sorted_arr2[i]) <=d:        valid = False    if valid:        count +=1return countWait, but what if the element in arr2 is not adjacent to the insertion point but still within d? For example, sorted_arr2 is [1, 4, 6], x=5, d=1. Then insertion index is 2. The elements to check are 4 (i-1=1) and 6 (i=2). The differences are 1 and 1. Both are <=d=1. So valid becomes False. So x=5 would not be counted, which is correct. But suppose sorted_arr2 is [1,2,3,4], x=5, d=1. Insertion index is 4 (since all elements are less than 5). So check i-1=3 (element 4). |5-4|=1 <=d=1. So invalid. So x=5 is not counted.Another example: sorted_arr2 is [3,6,8], x=5. Insertion index is 1 (since 5 is between 3 and 6). Check 3 (i-1=0) and 6 (i=1). |5-3|=2, |5-6|=1. So if d=1, then 6 is within. So x=5 is invalid.What if sorted_arr2 is [10, 20, 30], x=5, d=4. Insertion index is 0. So check element at 0 (10). |5-10|=5 >4. So x=5 would be valid. Because all elements in arr2 are >=10, and 10-5=5>4. So x=5 is counted.Another test case: sorted_arr2 is [1, 3, 5, 7], x=6, d=1. Insertion index is 3 (since 5 <6 <7). Check elements 5 (i-1=2) and 7 (i=3). 6-5=1 <=d, so x is invalid.Wait, but 7-6=1 also is <=d. So both are within. But even one is enough to invalidate x.So the code is correct in these cases.But what about if there's an element in arr2 that is not adjacent to the insertion point but is within d?For example, sorted_arr2 is [1, 4, 7], x=5, d=2. Insertion index is 2 (since 5 is between 4 and 7). Check 4 and 7. |5-4|=1 <=2, so invalid. But what if sorted_arr2 is [1, 5, 7], x=3, d=2. Insertion index is 1 (since 3 is between 1 and 5). Check 1 and 5. |3-1|=2 <=d, so invalid. Correct.But suppose sorted_arr2 is [1, 2, 3, 6], x=4, d=1. Insertion index is 3 (since 4 is between 3 and 6). Check elements at 3-1=2 (3) and 3 (6). |4-3|=1 <=d: yes. So invalid. Correct. But what if sorted_arr2 is [1,3,5,7], x=4, d=0. Insertion index is 2 (3 <4 <5). Check 3 and 5. |4-3|=1>0, |4-5|=1>0. So x=4 is valid. But wait, in arr2, there's no element 4. So the code correctly counts x=4 as valid because all elements in arr2 are either 3 (difference 1) or 5 (difference 1), which are both >0. So yes.Another example: arr2 = [10,9,1,8], sorted is [1,8,9,10]. x=8, d=2. Check insertion index. x=8 is in the array. bisect_left finds the first occurrence. So i=1 (since 8 is at index 1). Check 8 (i-1=0) is 1? No. Wait sorted array is [1,8,9,10]. So for x=8, bisect_left returns index 1 (since 8 is found at that position). So check elements at i-1=0 (1) and i=1 (8). |8-1|=7>2, |8-8|=0<=2. So x=8 is invalid, which matches the first example.Thus, this approach works.So the code should be:We need to import bisect.In the function, first sort arr2, then for each element in arr1, do the binary search.So the code:import bisectclass Solution:    def findTheDistanceValue(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int], d: int) -> int:        arr2.sort()        count = 0        for x in arr1:            i = bisect.bisect_left(arr2, x)            valid = True            # check left neighbor            if i > 0 and abs(x - arr2[i-1]) <= d:                valid = False            # check right neighbor            elif i < len(arr2) and abs(x - arr2[i]) <= d:                valid = False            if valid:                count += 1        return countWait, but in the case where i is 0, then we check only arr2[i], which is the first element. For example, x=0 in arr1, arr2 sorted is [5,6,7]. i would be 0. Then check if 5 -0 <=d. If d is 3, then 5-0=5>3, so valid. So x is counted. Correct.Another case: x=10, sorted arr2 is [5,6,7]. i would be 3 (beyond the array length). So we check i-1=2 (element 7). 10-7=3. If d is 3, then 3<=3, so x is invalid.So code handles that.But wait, in the code, after computing i = bisect.bisect_left(arr2, x), if i is len(arr2), then i is beyond the array. So in the code, 'i < len(arr2)' is False, so the code checks the right neighbor only if i is within bounds. But when i is len(arr2), then the right neighbor is out of bounds. But the left neighbor is i-1, which is len(arr2)-1. So for x being larger than all elements in arr2, check only the last element (i-1 = len(arr2)-1).Yes, that's correct.So this code should handle all cases.Now, let's test the sample inputs.Sample 1:arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], sorted arr2 is [1,8,9,10].For x=4:i = bisect.bisect_left([1,8,9,10],4) → returns 1 (since 4 is between 1 and 8). Check i-1=0 (1) and i=1 (8). |4-1|=3>2, |4-8|=4>2. So valid is True. So count +=1.x=5: i=1. Check 1 and 8. |5-1|=4>2, |5-8|=3>2. So valid. count=2.x=8: i=1 (since 8 is at position 1). Check 8-8=0 <=2 → valid becomes False. So not counted. Total count is 2. Correct.Sample 2:arr1 = [1,4,2,3], arr2 sorted is [-4,-3,6,10,20,30]. d=3.For x=1:i = bisect.bisect_left([-4,-3,6,10,20,30], 1) → returns 2 (since 1 is before 6). Check i-1=1 (-3) and i=2 (6). |1 - (-3)|=4>3, |1-6|=5>3. So valid → count +=1.x=4:i=2. Check elements 6 and previous. 4 - (-3) is 7>3. 4-6=2 <=3? 2 is <=3 → yes. So valid is False.x=2:i=2. Check elements 6 and -3. 2 - (-3)=5>3, 2-6=4>3. So valid → count +=1.x=3:i=2. 3 - (-3)=6>3, 3-6=3 <=3 → valid is False.So total count is 2. Which matches sample 2.Sample3:arr1 = [2,1,100,3], arr2 sorted is [-5,-3,-2,7,10], d=6.For x=2:i = bisect.bisect_left([-5,-3,-2,7,10], 2) → returns 3. Check elements at i-1=2 (-2) and i=3 (7). |2 - (-2)|=4 <=6 → so invalid. Not counted.x=1:i=3. Check elements -2 and 7. 1 - (-2)=3 <=6 → invalid.x=100:i=5 (beyond array length). Check i-1=4 (10). 100-10=90>6 → valid. So count +=1.x=3:i=3 (element 7 is at 3). Check 3 - (-2)=5 <=6 → invalid.So total count is 1. Which matches sample3.So the code works for the examples.Edge Cases:What if d=0? Then, the element in arr1 must not have any element in arr2 equal to it. So for x in arr1, check if x is present in arr2. But the code would find the insertion point and check adjacent elements. For example, if x is in arr2, then bisect_left finds the index where x is, and the right neighbor is x (if duplicates). Wait, but if the array has duplicates, like arr2 has [2,2,2], x=2. Then i=0. Check i-1 (invalid) and i=0 (element 2). |2-2|=0 <=0 → invalid. So x=2 is not counted. Correct.Another case: arr1 is [5], arr2 is [3,7], d=2. For x=5. Insertion index is 1 (between 3 and7). Check 3 and 7. |5-3|=2 <=2 → invalid. So count 0.If d=1, then |5-3|=2>1, |5-7|=2>1 → valid. So count is 1.Another edge case: when arr2 is empty. But according to constraints, arr2's length is >=1. So no problem.Another case: when all elements in arr1 are invalid. For example, arr1 is [5], arr2 is [5], d=0. Then count is 0.Thus, the code seems to handle all cases.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of elements in the first array (arr1) that are at a distance greater than a given integer (d) from all elements in the second array (arr2).

This is more efficient than a brute-force approach, especially for larger input sizes."},{"problem":"A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.We would like to convert the sentence to \\"Goat Latin\\" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append \\"ma\\" to the end of the word.        For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.         If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add \\"ma\\".        For example, the word \\"goat\\" becomes \\"oatgma\\".         Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.        For example, the first word gets \\"a\\" added to the end, the second word gets \\"aa\\" added to the end and so on.Return the final sentence representing the conversion from S to Goat Latin.  Example 1:Input: \\"I speak Goat Latin\\"Output: \\"Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa\\"Example 2:Input: \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\\"Output: \\"heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa\\" Notes:S contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces. Exactly one space between each word.1 <= S.length <= 150.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called toGoatLatin that takes a string S and converts it into Goat Latin based on the given rules. Hmm. Let me think through the steps carefully.First, the problem statement says that each word in the sentence is separated by spaces. So the first thing I'll need to do is split the input string into words. That's straightforward using the split() method. But wait, split by default splits on whitespace, and since the note says there's exactly one space between each word, splitting should work fine.Then, for each word, I need to process it according to the rules. Let's break down the rules:Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append \\"ma\\" to the end. Oh, but wait, the problem mentions both lowercase and uppercase letters. So the check for vowels should be case-insensitive. For example, the first word in example 1 is \\"I\\", which is a vowel. So the code needs to check the first character of the word, regardless of its case. So maybe convert the first character to lowercase and check if it is in {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}.Rule 2: If the word starts with a consonant, remove the first letter, append it to the end, then add \\"ma\\". So for \\"goat\\", remove 'g', append it to the end to get \\"oatg\\", then add \\"ma\\" making it \\"oatgma\\".Then, Rule 3: Add 'a's to the end of each word based on their index. The first word (index 0 in the list, but the count starts at 1) gets 'a', second gets 'aa', etc. So for the i-th word (starting from 0 in the list), we add (i+1) times 'a's.So the plan is:1. Split the input string into words.2. Iterate over each word with its index.3. For each word:   a. Check if the first letter is a vowel (case-insensitive).   b. Apply the corresponding transformation (rule 1 or 2).   c. Append the appropriate number of 'a's based on the index (i+1).4. Join all transformed words into a single string separated by spaces.Let me think about the processing of each word in more detail. Let's take the first example input: \\"I speak Goat Latin\\". The words are [\\"I\\", \\"speak\\", \\"Goat\\", \\"Latin\\"].Processing \\"I\\":- First character is 'I', which is a vowel. So add \\"ma\\" → \\"Ima\\". Then, since it's the first word (index 0), add 1 'a' → \\"Ima\\" + \\"a\\" → \\"Imaa\\". But wait, the example output is \\"Imaa\\". Oh right, because \\"I\\" becomes \\"Ima\\" then add one 'a' (since index starts at 0, 0+1=1 a's). So yes, that's correct.Next word \\"speak\\":- Starts with 's' (consonant). Remove first letter, append to end: \\"peak\\" + \\"s\\" → \\"peaks\\", then add \\"ma\\" → \\"peaksma\\". Then, since it's the second word (index 1), add 2 a's → \\"peaksmaa\\" + \\"a\\" (since index+1=2, so two a's? Wait, index starts at 0. So the first word (index 0) gets 1 a, second (index 1) gets 2, etc. So the index in the loop is from 0 to len(words)-1. For each word at index i, add (i+1) a's.So for \\"speak\\" which is the second word (index 1), add 2 a's. So after transformation, it's \\"peaksma\\" + \\"aa\\" → \\"peaksmaaa\\". Which matches the example output's second part \\"peaksmaaa\\".So the code steps for each word:For word in words:if first letter is vowel (case-insensitive):    transformed_word = word + \\"ma\\"else:    transformed_word = word[1:] + word[0] + \\"ma\\"then add (i+1) 'a's, where i is the index (starting from 0).So the code needs to track the index of each word. So when iterating, we can use enumerate, starting at 0.Now, let's think about edge cases. What about a word that's a single consonant? Like \\"g\\". Then, after removing the first letter (which is 'g'), appending it and adding 'ma' gives \\"\\" + \\"g\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"gma\\". Then add a's. So \\"g\\" becomes \\"gma\\" + a's.Another example: \\"apple\\". Starts with 'a', so append \\"ma\\" → \\"applema\\", then add a's based on index.What about uppercase letters? Like \\"Apple\\". The first letter 'A' is a vowel. So same as lowercase. So code should check the first character's lowercase form.So code steps:words = S.split()for each index, word in enumerate(words):    first_char = word[0].lower()    if first_char in {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}:        new_word = word + 'ma'    else:        new_word = word[1:] + word[0] + 'ma'    # add (index+1) 'a's    new_word += 'a' * (index + 1)    add to new_words listFinally, join with spaces.Wait, but what if the word is empty? But according to the problem statement, S contains words, so each word has at least one character. So no problem.Another test case: input is \\"The quick...\\" from example 2. Let's check the first word \\"The\\". Starts with 'T' (consonant). So remove 'T' → \\"he\\", add 'T' → \\"heT\\", add 'ma' → \\"heTma\\", then add 1 'a' (since it's first word, index 0) → \\"heTmaa\\". But example 2's first word in the output is \\"heTmaa\\". Wait, the example 2 input is \\"The quick brown fox...\\", output first word is \\"heTmaa\\". So the code seems to handle that.So the code steps are correct.Now, code structure.The function is part of a class Solution. So the code will be:class Solution:    def toGoatLatin(self, S: str) -> str:        # split into words        words = S.split()        vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}        result = []        for i, word in enumerate(words):            if word[0].lower() in vowels:                new_word = word + 'ma'            else:                new_word = word[1:] + word[0] + 'ma'            # add a's            new_word += 'a' * (i+1)            result.append(new_word)        return ' '.join(result)Wait, but let's test this code against example 1.Example 1:Input: \\"I speak Goat Latin\\"Split into [\\"I\\", \\"speak\\", \\"Goat\\", \\"Latin\\"]Processing each:\\"I\\" → starts with I (vowel). new_word = \\"I\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"Ima\\", then add 1 a → \\"Imaa\\".\\"speak\\" → starts with 's' (consonant). new_word = \\"peak\\" + \\"s\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"peaksma\\", then add 2 a's → \\"peaksmaaa\\".\\"Goat\\" → starts with 'G' (consonant). new_word = \\"oat\\" + \\"G\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"oatGma\\", add 3 a's → \\"oatGmaaaa\\" (since i is 2, 3 a's).\\"Latin\\" → starts with 'L' (consonant). new_word = \\"atin\\" + \\"L\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"atinLma\\", add 4 a's → \\"atinLmaaaaa\\". Wait, the example output is \\"Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa\\".Yes, the code's output for the fourth word would be \\"atinLma\\" + \\"aaaa\\" (since i+1=4), so \\"atinLma\\" followed by four a's: \\"atinLmaaaaa\\". Which matches the example.So the code seems correct.Another test: example 2.Input: \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\\"Processing the first word \\"The\\" → consonant. Take \\"he\\" + \\"T\\" → \\"heT\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"heTma\\". Add 1 a → \\"heTmaa\\". Which matches the first part of example 2's output.Second word \\"quick\\": starts with 'q' consonant. Remove 'q', append to end: \\"uickq\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"uickqma\\", add 2 a's → \\"uickqmaaa\\". Which matches the output's second word \\"uickqmaaa\\".Third word \\"brown\\": starts with 'b' consonant. new_word = \\"rown\\" + \\"b\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"rownbma\\", add 3 a's → \\"rownbmaaaa\\".Yes, in example 2, the third word is \\"rownbmaaaa\\".So the code seems to handle all cases.Potential issues:- Words with uppercase letters. But since we check the first character in lowercase, it's handled.- Words with only one letter. Like \\"a\\". Then, vowel → \\"a\\" + \\"ma\\" → \\"ama\\", then add a's. For example, if it's the first word, \\"amaa\\".- Edge case: empty string. But the note says 1 <= S.length <=150, so S is not empty.So I think the code is correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to convert a given sentence into Goat Latin based on specific rules. The transformation involves modifying each word according to whether it starts with a vowel or consonant, appending \\"ma\\", and adding a number of 'a's corresponding to the word's position in the sentence. Approach1. Split the Sentence: First, split the input sentence into individual words using spaces as delimiters.2. Process Each Word:   - Check Vowel: For each word, check if the first character is a vowel (case-insensitive).   - Modify Word:     - If the word starts with a vowel, append \\"ma\\" to the end.     - If the word starts with a consonant, move the first character to the end and append \\"ma\\".3. Add Suffix 'a's: Append a number of 'a's equal to the word's index (1-based) in the sentence.4. Reconstruct Sentence: Join all transformed words back into a single string with spaces separating them.

Splitting the Sentence: The input string is split into words using the \`split()\` method, which handles spaces efficiently.2. Vowel Check: Each word's first character is checked against a set of vowels for quick lookup. Converting the first character to lowercase ensures the check is case-insensitive.3. Word Transformation:   - Words starting with vowels are directly appended with \\"ma\\".   - Words starting with consonants are restructured by moving the first character to the end before appending \\"ma\\".4. Appending 'a's: For each word, the number of 'a's appended is determined by its 1-based index in the sentence list.5. Reconstructing the Sentence: The transformed words are joined into a single string with spaces to form the final result.This approach efficiently processes each word in linear time relative to the input length, ensuring clarity and adherence to the problem constraints."},{"problem":"Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.Example 1:Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3Output: trueExample 2:Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1Output: trueExample 3:Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2Output: false","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if there are two duplicate numbers in the array that are at most k positions apart. Let's think about how to approach this.The problem says two distinct indices i and j where nums[i] equals nums[j], and the absolute difference between i and j is <=k. So I need to track the positions of each number as I iterate through the array. If a number appears again and the current index minus the previous index is <=k, then return True. Otherwise, update the stored index to the current one and continue.Hmm, right. So maybe using a hash map to keep track of the last index each number was seen at. For each number in the array, check if it's already in the hash. If it is, subtract current index from the stored index. If the difference is <=k, return True. Otherwise, update the stored index. If not in the hash, add it.Wait, but what if a number appears more than twice? Like, say a number is seen at index 2, then again at 5, then again at 7. If k is 3, then 5-2 is 3, which is acceptable, so return True. So we need to check every time we encounter the number again. So the hash should store the most recent index. Because once a new occurrence is found, the next ones will be compared against the closest previous index.Yes. For example, in [1,0,1,1], k=1. Let's see:Index 0: 1 is added to the hash (1:0).Index 1: 0 is added.Index 2: 1 is found again. Current index 2 - previous index 0 = 2, which is >1. So update the hash to 1:2.Then index 3: 1 again. Current index 3 - previous index 2 is 1, which is <=k. So return True.So that's the case for example 2.So the approach would be:Initialize a dictionary to store the value and its latest index.Loop through each element in nums with their indices.For each element num at index i:- Check if num is in the dictionary.   - If yes, check if i - dict[num] <=k. If yes, return True.   - Then, regardless of whether the condition was met, update dict[num] to the current index i. Wait, no. Because if the difference is more than k, we still need to update the stored index to the current one, so that future occurrences can check against the closest previous index.Wait, right. Because if the next occurrence after that is within k, then that's a valid pair. So even if the current check fails, we need to update the index to the current one.So for example, in nums = [1,3,1,1], k=2:Index 0: 1 is added.Index 2: 1 again. 2-0=2, which is equal to k. So return True.But if the array was [1,3,4,1,1], k=2:At index 3, 1 is found again. The previous index is 0. 3-0=3>2. So we update the stored index to 3. Then at index 4, check 4-3=1 <=2, so return True.So the steps are correct.So the algorithm would be:Create a dictionary.Iterate through each num in nums with their index.For each num:If num is in the dictionary and current index - dict[num] <=k → return True.Then, update the dictionary with current index for num.Wait, but after checking, whether it's in the dictionary or not, you need to update the dictionary with the current index. Because even if it was there, we need to keep track of the latest index.Wait, for example, if a number is already in the dictionary, and we check the difference. If the difference is >k, then we need to update the dictionary's stored index to the current one, because the next occurrence can be closer to this current index.So the steps are:For each i in range(len(nums)):   num = nums[i]   if num in the dict and i - dict[num] <=k → return True   else → update dict[num] to iWait, but in the case where the num is in the dict but the difference is larger than k, we still update the stored index. Because the next occurrence might be within k of this current index.Yes.So the code would look like this.Let me test the examples.Example 1:nums = [1,2,3,1], k=3.Indices 0,1,2,3.At i=0: add 1:0.i=1: 2 not in dict → add.i=2:3 not in → add.i=3:1 is in dict. 3-0=3 which is equal to k. So return True.Which matches the example.Example 2:nums = [1,0,1,1], k=1.i=0: 1 → added.i=1:0 added.i=2:1. current index 2 -0 =2>1 → check fails. Update dict[1] to 2.i=3:1 is in dict. 3-2=1<=1 → return True.Yes.Example 3:nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k=2.Check each occurrence:i=0 (1) added.i=1 (2) added.i=2 (3) added.i=3 (1): check 3-0=3>2 → no. Update 1's index to 3.i=4 (2): check 4-1=3>2 → no. Update 2's index to4.i=5 (3): check 5-2=3>2 → no. Update 3's index to5.No duplicates within k distance. Return False.Which matches example3.So this approach should work.So the code would be:Create a dictionary, say last_seen.Loop through each i and num in enumerate(nums):   if num in last_seen and i - last_seen[num] <=k → return True.   else → last_seen[num] = i.After all, return False.Wait, but in code, for each num, check if it's in the dict. If yes, check the difference, if yes, return True. Else, update the dict. If not in dict, add it.So code would look like:def containsNearbyDuplicate(nums, k):    last_seen = {}    for i, num in enumerate(nums):        if num in last_seen and i - last_seen[num] <=k:            return True        last_seen[num] = i    return FalseWait, but wait. Let's test the case where a number appears multiple times.Like nums = [1,1,1], k=1.Indices 0,1,2.i=0: add 1:0.i=1: check 1 in dict. 1-0=1<=1 → return True. Correct.Another case: nums = [1,2,1,1], k=1.i=0: add 1.i=1: add 2.i=2: 1 is present. 2-0=2>1 → update to 2.i=3: 1 is present. 3-2=1 <=1 → return True.Yes.So this code should work.But what about when k is zero? Well, the problem says two distinct indices. So if k is zero, the indices must be same, which is not allowed. So for k=0, the function should return False, unless there's a number appearing twice but same index, which is impossible. So the code would handle it because i - last_seen[num] would be zero (only possible if same index, but since we're moving forward, the stored index would be from previous. So for example, k=0, nums = [1,1]. Then for i=1, check 1-0=1>0 → no. So returns False. Which is correct.Another test case: nums = [1], k= any → returns False.Yes.So the code seems correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if there are two distinct indices (i) and (j) in an array such that the values at these indices are equal and the absolute difference between (i) and (j) is at most (k).

As we iterate through the array, for each number, we check if it has been seen before and if the difference between the current index and the last seen index is within the allowed range (k).

Let's see. The problem says the Tribonacci sequence is defined with T0=0, T1=1, T2=1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous three. So for example, T3 is 0+1+1=2, T4 is 1+1+2=4 as given in the example.Hmm, so how do I approach this? Let's think about different methods. For small n, like up to 37, maybe a simple iterative approach would be efficient enough. Because even if we calculate each step one by one, 37 steps is trivial for a computer.Wait, what's the base cases here? If n is 0, return 0. If n is 1 or 2, return 1. For n >=3, each term is the sum of the previous three.So maybe the iterative method would work. Let's outline the steps:Initialize a list or variables to hold the previous three values. For example, start with a, b, c = 0, 1, 1. Then for each step from 3 to n, compute the next value as a + b + c, then update a, b, c to b, c, next_value. Repeat until reaching n.Let's test this logic with the example given. For n=4:Start with a=0, b=1, c=1 (for T0, T1, T2). Then for n=3, next is 0+1+1=2 (T3), so a becomes 1, b becomes 1, c becomes 2. Then for n=4, next is 1+1+2=4. So the result is 4, which matches the example.Another example, n=3: returns 2. That's correct.What about n=0? The function should return 0. For n=1 or 2, returns 1.So the iterative approach seems solid. Let's structure this:If n ==0: return 0If n ==1 or n==2: return 1Else:   a, b, c = 0, 1, 1   for i in range(3, n+1):       next_val = a + b + c       a = b       b = c       c = next_val   return cYes, that should work. Let's check for n=3. The loop runs once (i=3). next_val is 0+1+1=2. Then a becomes 1, b becomes 1, c becomes 2. Then return c which is 2. Correct.Another check for n=25. The iterative approach would loop from 3 to 25, which is 23 iterations. That's manageable and efficient.What about space? Using variables a, b, c is O(1) space, which is better than using a list to store all values up to n.So the iterative approach with O(n) time and O(1) space is appropriate here.Therefore, the Python function can be implemented as such. Now code that.Wait, but what if n is 0? We need to handle that first. Let's outline the code:def tribonacci(n: int) -> int:    if n == 0:        return 0    elif n == 1 or n == 2:        return 1    a, b, c = 0, 1, 1    for _ in range(3, n+1):        next_val = a + b + c        a = b        b = c        c = next_val    return cYes, that should work. Testing the sample input n=25, which outputs 1389537. Let's see:We can test the code step by step for small numbers. For example, n=3:Loop runs once (i=3). next_val = 0+1+1=2. So c becomes 2. Return c which is 2. Correct.n=4: loop runs for i=3 and i=4? Wait, no. range(3, n+1) when n=4 is 3 and 4. So the loop runs for 3 and 4. Wait, no. Wait, range(3, 4+1) is from 3 to 4 inclusive? Because in Python, range is up to but not including the end. So range(3,5) gives 3,4. So for n=4, the loop runs for 2 iterations. Wait, that's a problem.Wait, let's see. When n=4, the loop starts at 3 and ends at n (4). The range(3, n+1) is 3,4. So for each of those values of i, the code runs once. But for each iteration, we compute the next value. So for i=3, compute T3. Then i=4, compute T4.Wait, but in the code, for n=4, the loop runs from 3 to 4 inclusive. So two iterations. Let's see:Initial a=0, b=1, c=1.First iteration (i=3):next_val = 0+1+1=2. Then a becomes 1, b becomes 1, c becomes 2.Second iteration (i=4):next_val =1+1+2=4. a becomes 1, b becomes 2, c becomes4.Then return c=4. Which is correct.So the code works for n=4. So the code is correct.Therefore, the code is correct. The time complexity is O(n), which for n up to 37 is acceptable. Space is O(1). So this should be the correct approach.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to compute the nth element of the Tribonacci sequence, which is defined with specific initial values and a recurrence relation. The sequence starts with T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the three preceding terms. ApproachThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use an iterative method with constant space complexity. This method avoids the inefficiencies of recursion and the space overhead of storing all previous values. Instead, we maintain three variables to keep track of the last three values in the sequence and iteratively update them until we reach the nth term.1. Base Cases: Directly return the known values for n = 0, 1, or 2.2. Iterative Calculation: For n >= 3, initialize three variables to the first three values of the sequence.

The variables are then updated such that \`a\` takes the value of \`b\`, \`b\` takes the value of \`c\`, and \`c\` takes the newly computed next value.

Let me think through how to approach this.So the problem says that for each i, array[i] should be <= array[i+1], right? And we can change at most one element. So the idea is to find if there are at most one place where the order is decreasing, but even then, maybe modifying one element can fix it. But it's not just counting the number of inversions. Because sometimes even if there's one inversion, modifying one element might not be enough. Wait, let's look at the examples.In example 1: [4,2,3]. The inversion is at index 0 (4>2). But changing 4 to 1 (or 2) makes it okay. So output is True.In example 2: [4,2,1]. The inversions are between 4>2 and 2>1. So two inversions. Changing one element can't fix both. So output is False.But wait, what about a case where there is one inversion, but modifying one element isn't sufficient? Like [3,4,2,3]. Let's see: the inversion is between 4 and 2. So maybe when we find a dip, we have to check if modifying either the previous element or the current one would fix the array.So the approach should be: iterate through the array and count the number of times a number is followed by a smaller number. If there's more than one such occurrence, return False. But also, even if there's one occurrence, we need to check if modifying one of the elements can fix the problem.Wait, but how? For example, consider [5,7,1,8]. The inversion is at index 1 (7>1). If we change 7 to 1, then the array becomes [5,1,1,8], which is invalid because 5>1. Alternatively, changing 1 to 7 gives [5,7,7,8], which is valid. So in this case, modifying the second element (7) to be 1 doesn't work, but modifying the third element (1) to 7 works. So we need to check both possibilities when we encounter a dip.So the algorithm should be:Loop through the array, track the number of modifications needed. Whenever a dip is found (nums[i] > nums[i+1]), we have two options: either change nums[i] to be <= nums[i+1], or change nums[i+1] to be >= nums[i]. Then we need to check if either of these changes would result in the rest of the array being non-decreasing.But how to implement this efficiently?Hmm. Let's think of the steps:Initialize a counter for modifications, count = 0.For each i from 0 to len(nums)-2:   if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:       increment count. If count >1, return False.       Now, check if modifying nums[i] or nums[i+1] can fix the problem.       For example, in the case of nums[i-1] > nums[i+1], then we need to set nums[i+1] = nums[i], otherwise setting nums[i] = nums[i+1].Wait, maybe the logic is: when we find a dip at i and i+1, we need to check the previous element (i-1) to decide which element to adjust.Like, if i is 0 (the first element), then we can just set nums[i] to nums[i+1], which is allowed. But if i is not zero, then we have to check if nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]. If so, then we can set nums[i] = nums[i-1], which would fix the dip. Otherwise, we have to set nums[i+1] = nums[i] to maintain the non-decreasing order.Wait, maybe this is a better way: when a dip is found, there are two options:Option 1: Lower nums[i] to nums[i+1]. But this can only be done if nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1], assuming i>0. If i is 0, then this is always possible.Option 2: Raise nums[i+1] to nums[i]. But this may cause issues with subsequent elements.But how do we check which option is possible without modifying the array each time?Alternatively, when we encounter a dip, we can check both possibilities and see if either leads to a valid array. However, this approach would require checking the rest of the array each time, which could be O(n) for each dip. Since there's at most one dip (because count is kept), the total time would be O(n), which is acceptable.Wait, but how to track this? Let's see:Suppose during the iteration, when we find a dip, we can check whether modifying nums[i] to be equal to nums[i+1] (or to nums[i-1] if possible) would make the rest of the array valid. Or modifying nums[i+1] to be equal to nums[i].But how to check this without actually modifying the array? Because modifying the array would affect the rest of the checks.Alternatively, when we encounter a dip, we can make a copy of the array, perform one modification, and check the rest. But for large arrays (up to 10^4 elements), making copies might be expensive. So perhaps there's a smarter way.Wait, but when there's a dip at index i, we can only have one such dip. So once we've handled that dip, the rest of the array needs to be non-decreasing.So here's an idea: whenever we find a dip at i, we can check two possibilities:1. Set nums[i] = nums[i+1]. Then check if the rest of the array (from i-1 onwards) is non-decreasing. Wait, but if i is not the first element, then we need to ensure that nums[i-1] <= nums[i] (now set to nums[i+1]). For example, if the array was [3, 5, 4], the dip is at 5 and 4. If we set 5 to 4, then the array becomes [3,4,4], which is valid. But if the array was [4, 5, 3], then setting 5 to 3 gives [4,3,3], which is invalid because 4>3. So in this case, we have to adjust the next element instead.So when we find a dip at i:If i is 0, then set nums[i] to nums[i+1], and continue checking the rest.Else, if nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1], then set nums[i] to nums[i-1] (or nums[i+1], whichever is better), and check the rest.Else, set nums[i+1] to nums[i], and check the rest.But how to check the rest without modifying the array? Because modifying the array would change the original data.So perhaps the way to handle this is to track the previous value and see if the rest of the array is valid.Alternatively, we can keep track of the last value and continue checking.Wait, maybe here's a way:When we encounter a dip at i (i.e., nums[i] > nums[i+1]), we need to consider two scenarios:1. We change nums[i] to be <= nums[i+1]. So the new nums[i] is min(nums[i], nums[i+1]). Wait, no. Because in the original array, nums[i] is larger than nums[i+1]. So to make it non-decreasing, we can either:   a. Decrease nums[i] so that it's <= nums[i+1], but also >= nums[i-1] (if i>0).   b. Increase nums[i+1] to be >= nums[i], but also <= nums[i+2] (if i+2 exists).But how to check this without modifying the array.Alternatively, for each dip, we can check if modifying nums[i] or nums[i+1] would fix the problem.So here's a possible approach:Initialize a variable count to 0.Loop through the array from left to right, for each i from 0 to n-2:   if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:       count +=1       if count >1:           return False       Now, check if we can modify nums[i] or nums[i+1] to resolve this.       If i ==0:           then modifying nums[i] to nums[i+1] is allowed. So proceed. The previous element is not there, so after modification, the next check would be between nums[i+1] and nums[i+2], etc.       else:           if nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]:               # we can set nums[i] to nums[i+1], which is >= nums[i-1], thus the previous sequence is okay.               # but we need to ensure that the next elements (i+1 onwards) are non-decreasing.               # but since we have modified nums[i], perhaps we need to continue checking.               # Alternatively, since we are only allowed one modification, after this, we can proceed and check the rest.               # However, the problem is that the rest of the array may have other dips, but since we have already used our modification, if there's another dip, it's invalid.               # Wait, but the count is already increased. So when we proceed, if there's another dip, count would be 2.               # So perhaps, in this case, after handling this dip, we need to check the rest of the array.               # For example, in the array [3,4,2,3], the first dip is at i=1 (4>2). If we modify 4 to 2, then the array becomes [3,2,2,3], which has a dip at i=0 (3>2). So count would be 2. But this approach would have already returned False.               # So perhaps when we modify nums[i], we need to check that nums[i-1] <= nums[i] (modified) and nums[i] <= nums[i+1].               # Wait, in the case where we have to modify, the current dip is resolved, but the previous elements (i-1 and i) need to be checked.               # Alternatively, maybe after modifying, the previous elements are okay, and we can proceed.               # Hmm, this is getting complicated.               # Let's think of this approach:               # When a dip is found at i, check if modifying nums[i] to be equal to nums[i-1] (if possible) or nums[i+1] would allow the rest of the array to be non-decreasing.               # So for the dip at i:               # Option 1: set nums[i] = nums[i-1]. Then check if this would make the next comparison (nums[i] and nums[i+1]) valid.               # Option 2: set nums[i+1] = nums[i]. Then check if the next comparison (nums[i+1] and nums[i+2]) is valid.               # But how to check this without actually modifying the array.               # So perhaps, when we encounter a dip, we can check both possibilities by comparing the necessary elements.               # For example:               # Case 1: i is 0. Then changing nums[0] to nums[1] is allowed, as there's no previous element. Then proceed.               # But after changing, the next comparison is between nums[0] (now nums[1]) and nums[1] (original). Since nums[0] (changed) is now <= nums[1], but then the rest of the array must be checked.               # However, since we can't modify the array, we can simulate this by checking if the next element (i+1) is >= nums[i-1] (if i>0).               # Alternatively, perhaps the logic is as follows:               # When you find nums[i] > nums[i+1], you can fix this by either:               # a) Making nums[i] as small as possible (so that it's <= nums[i+1] and >= nums[i-1] if i>0). So if i>0 and nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1], then set nums[i] to nums[i-1] or nums[i+1], which would fix the dip.               # Or,               # b) Making nums[i+1] as large as possible (so that it's >= nums[i], and if there is an element after i+1, then nums[i+1] <= nums[i+2], but that might not be necessary if we are allowed to make that change.               # So for the dip at i:               # If i is 0, then the only option is to set nums[i] to nums[i+1]. Then proceed.               # Else, if nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1], then we can set nums[i] = nums[i+1], which would fix the dip. Then check the rest of the array.               # Else, we have to set nums[i+1] = nums[i], which could cause a problem with the next element (i+2) if it's less than nums[i+1].               # But how to check that.               # Maybe the key is that when we make this modification, the next element (i+1) has to be >= the previous element (i-1) and <= the next element (i+2).               # Wait, perhaps the correct approach is when we find a dip, we can check whether the previous element is <= the next element (nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]). If so, then we can adjust nums[i] to be either nums[i-1] or nums[i+1], which would fix the dip and allow the rest of the array to be checked. Otherwise, we have to adjust nums[i+1] to be equal to nums[i], but then we have to check that the next elements (i+1, i+2, etc.) are non-decreasing.               # So here's the algorithm:               # When a dip is found at i:               #   if i == 0:               #       count +=1, and proceed. Because you can set nums[0] to nums[1], which makes the first two elements valid. Then check the rest.               #   else:               #       if nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]:               #           count +=1, and check the rest of the array as if nums[i] was adjusted to nums[i+1]. So the next comparison would be between nums[i+1] and nums[i+2].               #       else:               #           if nums[i] > nums[i+1], then we can set nums[i+1] to nums[i]. So we have to check that nums[i+1] (now nums[i]) <= nums[i+2], if it exists.               #           So in this case, count +=1, and then the next comparison is between the new nums[i+1] (nums[i]) and nums[i+2].               # But how to check the next elements without modifying the array. Because modifying the array would change the original data.               # So perhaps, when we have a dip at i, we can check the two possibilities:               # 1. The dip can be fixed by adjusting nums[i], and then the rest of the array (from i+1 onwards) must be non-decreasing.               # 2. Or, it can be fixed by adjusting nums[i+1], and then the rest of the array (from i+2 onwards) must be non-decreasing.               # But how to check that.               # Wait, perhaps when a dip is found, the code can check if either of these two possibilities would work. For example:               # For possibility 1:               # Check if (i ==0 or nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]) and (the rest of the array from i+1 onwards is non-decreasing if nums[i] is adjusted to nums[i+1])               # For possibility 2:               # Check if (nums[i] <= nums[i+2] (if i+2 exists)) and the rest of the array from i+2 onwards is non-decreasing when nums[i+1] is adjusted to nums[i]               # But how to check this without actually modifying the array.               # Alternatively, perhaps after making the adjustment (either nums[i] to nums[i+1] or nums[i+1] to nums[i]), the rest of the array must be non-decreasing. So when we find a dip, we need to check both possibilities and see if either leads to a valid array.               # So, for example, in code:               # when a dip is found at i:               #   if count >0: return False               #   check option1: can we change nums[i] to nums[i+1]? Then check if the array up to i and then the rest is non-decreasing.               #   check option2: can we change nums[i+1] to nums[i]? Then check the same.               #   if either option is possible, return True, else return False.               # But how to implement this.               # For option1: check if (i==0 or nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]) and check the rest of the array from i+1 to end, ensuring that nums[i+1] >= nums[i+2] (if any) etc.               # Wait, but after changing nums[i] to nums[i+1], the next comparison is between the new nums[i] (which is nums[i+1]) and nums[i+1], which is the same as before. So in this case, the rest of the array is checked as normal.               # Alternatively, perhaps after the dip, we can continue checking the array, but in the case where we have to choose between modifying i or i+1, we can check whether either of the possibilities would work.               # So, perhaps the algorithm is:               # Initialize count =0               # for i from 0 to len(nums)-2:               #   if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:               #       count +=1               #       if count >1:               #           return False               #       if i ==0:               #           # option1: change nums[i] to nums[i+1]               #           # after that, check the rest.               #           # but how?               #           # but since we are not modifying the array, perhaps we can check if the next elements are non-decreasing.               #           # but since we've already checked up to i+1, the rest of the elements may have another dip.               #           # wait, no. Because in the original array, after changing nums[0] to nums[1], the array becomes [nums[1], nums[1], nums[2], ...]               #           # So the next comparison is between nums[1] and nums[2], which is already in the original array.               #           # So in this case, the rest of the array is as before. So we can proceed with the next i.               #           # but perhaps we need to check if nums[i+1] <= nums[i+2], and so on.               #           # However, how to account for the modification we made in nums[i]?               #           # Because modifying nums[i] would affect the next comparison (i+1 and i+2).               #           # For example, suppose the array is [5, 3, 4]. The dip is at 0. Changing 5 to 3 gives [3,3,4], which is valid. So in this case, after modifying, the next comparison is between 3 and 4, which is okay.               #           # But how to check this without modifying the array.               #           # Maybe in this case, when we change nums[i] to nums[i+1], the next check for i+1 would be between nums[i+1] (3) and nums[i+2] (4), which is okay.               #           # So in code, after changing nums[i], the next elements would be checked as per the original array. But the modified value of nums[i] is not considered beyond the current dip.               #           # Hmm, but this could lead to errors. For example, in the array [3,4,2,3], the dip is at i=1 (4>2). If we change nums[1] to 2, then the array becomes [3,2,2,3]. Now, the next comparison (i=0) is 3>2, which is another dip. But since we have already incremented count to 1, when we check the next i (i=0), we will process that dip, but count would become 2, leading to False.               #           # So in this case, the code would correctly return False, as the modification leads to another dip.               #           # So perhaps, after making the modification (even though we are not actually modifying the array), the next elements are processed as per the original array.               #           # So the code can proceed by checking the rest of the array, but when a modification is made, it affects the previous element.               #           # Wait, but how?               #           # Let me think of the example [3,4,2,3]. The dip is at i=1 (4>2). When processing this dip:               #           # count becomes 1. Then, check if we can modify i=1 or i+1=2.               #           # For modifying i=1 (4 to 2), the next check would be between 2 (i=1) and 3 (i+1=2). But in the original array, the next element after 2 (i+1=2) is 3, which is okay. So after modification, the array is [3,2,2,3], but then the check between i=0 (3) and i=1 (2) would have been a dip. But since we have already processed up to i=1, the code would have already moved past i=0. So this approach may not catch that.               #           # Ah, this is a problem. Because in the modified array, the previous elements may have dips that were not checked. So the code's approach of moving forward may miss those.               #           # So this suggests that the approach of counting dips and modifying when possible is insufficient, because a modification may introduce a dip earlier in the array.               #           # For example, in [3,4,2,3], changing 4 to 2 creates a dip between 3 and 2, which would require another modification. But since we process the array left to right, after modifying i=1, we proceed to check i=2, but the dip at i=0 is behind us and not checked again.               #           # So this approach would incorrectly return True, but the correct answer is False. Wait, no. The original array [3,4,2,3] can be modified by changing the 4 to 3, making [3,3,2,3], but that's still a dip between 3 and 2. Or changing the 2 to 4, making [3,4,4,3], which has a dip between 4 and 3. So in this case, the correct answer should be False. But wait, perhaps another way: change the 2 to 4 gives [3,4,4,3], which has a dip at 4>3, which is another modification. So two modifications are needed. So the correct answer is False.               #           # So in this case, the code would count the initial dip (4>2) as one, then check if the rest of the array is okay after modification. But after modifying, the code may proceed and not notice the previous dip.               #           # So how to handle this?               #           # The problem arises because modifying a dip at i may introduce a new dip at i-1.               #           # So the code must check for that possibility.               #           # So perhaps the way to handle this is when a dip is found at i, check both possibilities (modify i or modify i+1) and see if either of them leads to a valid array.               #           # To do this, we can make copies of the array and perform the modification, then check if the modified array is non-decreasing. But for large arrays, this would be O(n^2) time, which might be acceptable since n is up to 1e4.               #           # But for efficiency, perhaps we can find a way to check this without making copies.               #           # So here's another idea:               #           # When a dip is found at i, there are two possible ways to fix it:               #           # 1. Set nums[i] = nums[i+1], and ensure that the previous elements are non-decreasing.               #           # 2. Set nums[i+1] = nums[i], and ensure that the next elements are non-decreasing.               #           # So for each case, check if after making this modification, the entire array is non-decreasing.               #           # But how to check this efficiently.               #           # For case 1:               #           # After setting nums[i] to nums[i+1], check if the array up to i+1 is non-decreasing, and then check the rest.               #           # For case 2:               #           # After setting nums[i+1] to nums[i], check if the array from i onwards is non-decreasing, and then check the rest.               #           # But how to do this without creating copies.               #           # For case 1:               #           # Check if (i ==0 or nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]) and that the rest of the array (i+1 onwards) is non-decreasing.               #           # Because after modifying nums[i], the only possible new dip is between i-1 and i. So if i is not 0, we need to ensure that nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1] (the new nums[i] is nums[i+1]). Then, the rest of the array must be checked.               #           # For case 2:               #           # Check that nums[i] <= nums[i+2] (if i+2 exists) and that the rest of the array from i+1 is non-decreasing.               #           # Because after modifying nums[i+1] to nums[i], we need to ensure that nums[i+1] (now nums[i]) <= nums[i+2].               #           # So the algorithm can be:               #           # When a dip is found at i:               #           # if count >0, return False.               #           # check if modifying i or i+1 can make the array non-decreasing.               #           # return True if either is possible.               #           # So code steps:               #           # Check if either:               #           # (i ==0 or nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]) and the rest of the array from i+1 is non-decreasing (after modifying nums[i] to nums[i+1])               #           # OR               #           # (i == len(nums)-2 or nums[i] <= nums[i+2]) and the rest of the array from i+2 is non-decreasing (after modifying nums[i+1] to nums[i])               #           # How to check the rest of the array.               #           # For the first option, after modifying nums[i] to nums[i+1], the array up to i+1 must be non-decreasing. Then, from i+1 onwards, the rest must be non-decreasing.               #           # But since we are not modifying the array, how to check this.               #           # Maybe after modifying nums[i] to nums[i+1], the next check is between i and i+1 (which is nums[i+1] and nums[i+1]), which is okay. Then, check the rest of the array starting from i+1.               #           # Wait, but after modifying nums[i], the previous elements (before i) need to be checked. For example, after modifying i=1 in [3,4,2,3], the array becomes [3,2,2,3]. Now, the elements before i=1 (i=0 and i=1) are 3 and 2, which is a dip. So this approach would miss this.               #           # So the problem is that modifying nums[i] can create a new dip in the earlier part of the array. So the code must check the entire array after the modification, but doing this naively would require O(n) time for each modification.               #           # But since there's at most one modification allowed, perhaps this is manageable.               #           # So here's the plan:               #           # When a dip is found at i, we need to check two possibilities:               #           # 1. The array can be made non-decreasing by setting nums[i] = nums[i+1]. To check this, we can:               #           #    a. Check if i ==0 or nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1] (since after setting nums[i] to nums[i+1], the previous element (i-1) must be <= nums[i]).               #           #    b. Check if the rest of the array (from i+1 onwards) is non-decreasing.               #           # 2. The array can be made non-decreasing by setting nums[i+1] = nums[i]. To check this:               #           #    a. Check if the next element (i+2) is >= nums[i] (since nums[i+1] is now nums[i]).               #           #    b. Check if the rest of the array (from i+2 onwards) is non-decreasing.               #           # If either of these possibilities is true, then return True. Otherwise, return False.               #           # So the code would need to implement these checks.               #           # Now, how to check if the rest of the array is non-decreasing.               #           # For option 1, after setting nums[i] to nums[i+1], we need to check from i+1 onwards.               #           # For option 2, after setting nums[i+1] to nums[i], check from i+1 onwards.               #           # But the original array has nums[i] > nums[i+1], which is the dip. So after modification, the rest of the array may still have dips.               #           # So for option 1:               #           # We can create a new array where nums[i] is set to nums[i+1], then check if the entire array is non-decreasing.               #           # But this would require O(n) time and O(n) space. For large arrays, this might be acceptable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.               #           # Alternatively, to check the rest of the array without modifying:               #           # For option 1, after the modification, the next elements (i+1 and beyond) must be non-decreasing. But how?               #           # Because after modifying nums[i] to nums[i+1], the next comparison is between nums[i+1] and nums[i+2], which is part of the original array.               #           # So for option 1, after modifying i, the array from i+1 onwards is the same as the original array, except for the modified i. But the comparison between i and i+1 is now okay (since we set nums[i] to nums[i+1], so nums[i] <= nums[i+1]).               #           # The problem is with the previous comparison between i-1 and i. So after modifying i, we have to check if nums[i-1] <= nums[i] (modified). And then check the rest.               #           # So for option 1:               #           # if i > 0 and nums[i-1] > nums[i+1], then modifying nums[i] to nums[i+1] will create a new dip between i-1 and i.               #           # So for option 1 to be valid, it's necessary that nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]. And the rest of the array from i+1 must be non-decreasing.               #           # Similarly, for option 2:               #           # after setting nums[i+1] to nums[i], we need to check that nums[i+1] (now nums[i]) <= nums[i+2], and the rest is non-decreasing.               #           # So in code, the logic would be:               #           # when a dip is found at i:               #           # count +=1               #           # if count >1: return False               #           # option1 = True               #           # if i >0:               #           #     option1 = (nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1])               #           # if option1:               #           #     # check rest of the array from i+1               #           #     # but after modifying nums[i], the next elements are i+1 and beyond.               #           #     # So check if the rest of the array from i+1 is non-decreasing.               #           #     # Wait, but the original array has a dip at i. After modifying, the dip is fixed, but what about the rest?               #           #     # For example, the array could be [1,4,3,2]. Dip at i=1. If we modify i=1 to 3 (nums[i+1] is 3), then the array becomes [1,3,3,2]. Then, the next dip is between 3 and 2. So another modification is needed.               #           #     # So option1 requires that after modifying i, the rest of the array has no dips.               #           #     # So for option1, we need to check the entire array from i+1 onwards.               #           #     j = i+1               #           #     while j < len(nums)-1:               #           #         if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:               #           #             option1 = False               #           #             break               #           #         j +=1               #           # option2 = True               #           # if i+1 < len(nums)-1:               #           #     option2 = (nums[i] <= nums[i+2])               #           # if option2:               #           #     j = i+1               #           #     while j < len(nums)-1:               #           #         if j == i+1:               #           #             if nums[i] > nums[j+1]:               #           #                 option2 = False               #           #                 break               #           #         else:               #           #             if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:               #           #                 option2 = False               #           #                 break               #           #         j +=1               #           # return option1 or option2               #           # But this approach would require checking the rest of the array for option1 and option2, which may take O(n) time each. But since the entire array is O(n), the total time is O(n).               #           # So for example, for option1, after handling the dip at i, the code would check whether the rest of the array (from i+1) is non-decreasing.               #           # Similarly for option2.               #           # So let's see:               #           # For example, in [4,2,3], the dip is at i=0. Option1 is to set nums[0] to 2. Then check the rest of the array (i+1=1 onwards) which is [2,3], which is okay. So option1 is True. So return True.               #           # In example 2: [4,2,1]. Dip at i=0. option1 is to set nums[0] to 2. Then check rest of array [2,1], which has a dip. So option1 is False. option2: set nums[1] to 4. Now check rest of array (from i+1=1). nums[1] is 4, next is 1: 4>1. So option2 is False. So return False.               #           # In the [3,4,2,3] case: dip at i=1 (4>2). option1: check if nums[0] <= nums[2] (3 <=2? No). So option1 is False. option2: check if nums[1] <= nums[3] (4 <=3? No). So option2 is False. So return False.               #           # So this approach seems to work.               #           # So the code would look like this:               #           # Initialize count =0               #           # for i in range(len(nums)-1):               #           #     if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:               #           #         count +=1               #           #         if count >1:               #           #             return False               #           #         # check option1 and option2               #           #         option1 = True               #           #         option2 = True               #           #         # check option1: modify nums[i] to nums[i+1]               #           #         # need to check if i ==0 or nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]               #           #         if i >0:               #           #             if nums[i-1] > nums[i+1]:               #           #                 option1 = False               #           #         # then check if the rest of the array (from i+1 onwards) is non-decreasing               #           #         j = i+1               #           #         while j < len(nums)-1 and option1:               #           #             if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:               #           #                 option1 = False               #           #             j +=1               #           #         # check option2: modify nums[i+1] to nums[i]               #           #         # need to check if i+1 == len(nums)-1 or nums[i] <= nums[i+2]               #           #         if i+1 < len(nums)-1:               #           #             if nums[i] > nums[i+2]:               #           #                 option2 = False               #           #         # then check if the rest of the array (from i+2 onwards) is non-decreasing, and also i+1 vs i+2               #           #         j = i+1               #           #         # after modifying, nums[i+1] is now nums[i]. So check if nums[i] <= nums[i+2] (if exists)               #           #         # then check the rest from i+2 onwards.               #           #         # but for j starting at i+1, the next element is j+1 = i+2.               #           #         # so in the modified array, nums[i+1] is nums[i]. So check if nums[i] <= nums[i+2], then check the rest.               #           #         # So for j from i+1:               #           #         while j < len(nums)-1 and option2:               #           #             if j == i+1:               #           #                 if nums[i] > nums[j+1]:               #           #                     option2 = False               #           #                     break               #           #             else:               #           #                 if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:               #           #                     option2 = False               #           #                     break               #           #             j +=1               #           #         # if either option is possible, return True, else continue.               #           #         # but wait, after this dip is handled, there may be more dips later.               #           #         # but since we have count <=1, we can continue checking.               #           #         # So the code needs to return whether either option is possible, but after handling this, need to continue processing the array.               #           #         # Wait, no. Because once we make a modification (either option1 or option2), we have to assume that the rest of the array is checked under that modification.               #           #         # However, the code continues to process the array as before. So for example, after modifying option1, the code would proceed to check the next elements, but in reality, the array may have other dips that were already accounted for.               #           #         # So perhaps, after handling this dip, the code should return whether either option is possible. Because once a modification is made, the rest of the array must be non-decreasing.               #           #         # So the code would return option1 or option2.               #           #         # But this is not correct. Because after making the modification, there might be other dips in the array that are not accounted for.               #           #         # For example, consider array [5,7,1,8]. The dip is at i=1 (7>1). option1 is to modify 7 to 1. Then the array becomes [5,1,1,8]. The rest of the array (from i+1=2 onwards) is [1,8], which is okay. So option1 is True. However, the code would return True, but the actual array after modification would have a dip between 5 and 1. So the code's approach is incorrect.               #           #         # So the problem is that option1's check only verifies the rest of the array, not the previous elements.               #           #         # So the code's current approach is flawed.               #           #         # Therefore, the code needs to check the entire array after the modification, not just the rest.               #           #         # So for option1, after modifying nums[i] to nums[i+1], the code needs to check if the entire array is non-decreasing. Similarly for option2.               #           #         # How to do this efficiently.               #           #         # One way is to create a modified array and check it. But that's O(n) time and space for each option.               #           #         # Another way is to simulate the check without creating a new array.               #           #         # For option1: after setting nums[i] to nums[i+1], check if the array is non-decreasing.               #           #         # So for option1:               #           #         # Check if the array up to i-1 is non-decreasing, then check nums[i-1] <= nums[i] (modified), then check nums[i] (modified) <= nums[i+1], then check the rest.               #           #         # But how to do this without modifying the array.               #           #         # For option1:               #           #         # The modified array would have nums[i] set to nums[i+1]. So in this case, the array is non-decreasing if:               #           #         # (i ==0 or nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]) and (nums[i+1] <= nums[i+1]) and the rest from i+1 is non-decreasing.               #           #         # But since nums[i+1] is the same as the original array, the rest from i+1 is already checked.               #           #         # Wait, no. Because the rest from i+1 includes elements beyond i+1. For example, the array could be [3, 5, 4, 6]. The dip is at i=1 (5>4). So option1 would modify 5 to 4, making the array [3,4,4,6]. Then the rest of the array is [4,6], which is okay. But after modifying, the code needs to ensure that the entire array is non-decreasing, including the new 3 <=4 (which is okay), and the new 4 <=4 (okay), then 4 <=6 (okay). So option1 is valid.               #           #         # However, in the case of [5,7,1,8], modifying 7 to 1 makes the array [5,1,1,8], which has a dip between 5 and 1. So option1's check would fail because the previous elements (i=0) are now 5>1.               #           #         # So the code's current approach for option1 is incomplete, as it doesn't check the previous elements.               #           #         # So the code's current approach is not sufficient.               #           #         # So how to check the entire array after the modification.               #           #         # For option1, the modified array would have nums[i] = nums[i+1]. The entire array must be non-decreasing.               #           #         # So to check this:               #           #         # Loop through the array, and at each step, check if current element is <= next element. But during this check, when we reach i-1 and i, we need to use the modified value of nums[i].               #           #         # But without modifying the array, this is possible by adjusting the comparison during the loop.               #           #         # For example:               #           #         # To check option1:               #           #         # Create a variable modified_i_value = nums[i+1]               #           #         # Then, loop through the array:               #           #         # for j in range(len(nums)-1):               #           #         #     current = nums[j] if j !=i else modified_i_value               #           #         #     next_val = nums[j+1] if j+1 !=i else modified_i_value               #           #         #     if current > next_val:               #           #         #         option1 = False               #           #         #         break               #           #         # But this would require O(n) time for each option.               #           #         # Similarly for option2.               #           #         # So this approach would have O(n) time complexity, which is acceptable for n=1e4.               #           #         # So in code:               #           #         # When a dip is found at i:               #           #         # check option1:               #           #         # make a copy of the array, set nums[i] to nums[i+1], check if the copy is non-decreasing.               #           #         # check option2:               #           #         # make a copy of the array, set nums[i+1] to nums[i], check if the copy is non-decreasing.               #           #         # return True if either copy is non-decreasing.               #           #         # But making copies is O(n) time and space, which could be acceptable.               #           #         # For example:               #           #         def checkPossibility(nums):               #           #             count =0               #           #             for i in range(len(nums)-1):               #           #                 if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:               #           #                     count +=1               #           #                     if count >1:               #           #                         return False               #           #                     # check option1 and option2               #           #                     # option1: modify nums[i] to nums[i+1]               #           #                     copy1 = list(nums)               #           #                     copy1[i] = copy1[i+1]               #           #                     valid1 = True               #           #                     for j in range(len(copy1)-1):               #           #                         if copy1[j] > copy1[j+1]:               #           #                             valid1 = False               #           #                             break               #           #                     # option2: modify nums[i+1] to nums[i]               #           #                     copy2 = list(nums)               #           #                     copy2[i+1] = copy2[i]               #           #                     valid2 = True               #           #                     for j in range(len(copy2)-1):               #           #                         if copy2[j] > copy2[j+1]:               #           #                             valid2 = False               #           #                             break               #           #                     if valid1 or valid2:               #           #                         return True               #           #                     else:               #           #                         return False               #           #             return True               #           #         # But wait, after modifying the array, if the code returns True, but what about the rest of the array? For example, if there are no other dips, but after this modification, other parts may have dips.               #           #         # Wait, the code creates copies and checks the entire array. So this approach would correctly check the entire array after the modification.               #           #         # For example, in the [5,7,1,8] case:               #           #         # modifying 7 to 1 (option1) creates [5,1,1,8]. Then the code checks if this array is non-decreasing. It would find 5>1 and return False. For option2, modify 1 to7, creating [5,7,7,8], which is non-decreasing. So valid2 is True. So the code returns True.               #           #         # But the original array after modification would have [5,7,7,8], which is non-decreasing. So the code returns True, which is correct.               #           #         # In the [3,4,2,3] case:               #           #         # option1: modifying 4 to2 creates [3,2,2,3]. The code checks this array and finds 3>2, returns False. option2: modify 2 to4, creating [3,4,4,3]. Check this array: 4>3 at the end. So valid2 is False. So code returns False.               #           #         # Which is correct.               #           #         # This approach seems correct. But what about the time complexity? For each dip, two copies of the array are made (O(n) space each), and two O(n) checks. For n=1e4, this would be O(n) time. Since there's at most one dip, the total time is O(n), which is acceptable.               #           #         # So this code should work.               #           #         # But the problem is that for large arrays, making two copies each time could be expensive in terms of memory, but for the given constraints (n up to 1e4), it's manageable.               #           #         # Let's test the code with the examples.               #           #         # Example 1: [4,2,3]               #           #         # dip is at i=0. count becomes 1.               #           #         # option1: modify 4 to2, array [2,2,3]. Check if this is non-decreasing: yes. valid1 is True. So return True.               #           #         # So code returns True.               #           #         # Example 2: [4,2,1]. dip at i=0. count becomes 1.               #           #         # option1: modify 4 to 2. array [2,2,1]. Check: 2>1. valid1 is False.               #           #         # option2: modify 2 to4. array [4,4,1]. Check: 4>1. valid2 is False. So return False.               #           #         # Which is correct.               #           #         # Another test case: [5,7,1,8]               #           #         # dip at i=1. count=1.               #           #         # option1: modify 7 to1. array [5,1,1,8]. Check: 5>1. invalid.               #           #         # option2: modify 1 to7. array [5,7,7,8]. Check valid. So code returns True.               #           #         # Which is correct.               #           #         # Another test case: [3,4,2,3]               #           #         # dip at i=1. count=1.               #           #         # option1: modify 4 to2. array [3,2,2,3]. Check: 3>2. invalid.               #           #         # option2: modify 2 to4. array [3,4,4,3]. Check:4>3. invalid. So code returns False. Correct.               #           #         # So this code seems to handle all cases.               #           #         # Now, let's think about the code's structure.               #           #         # The code loops through the array once. For each element, if a dip is found, it checks the two possibilities, makes copies, and returns True or False. If no dip is found, returns True.               #           #         # But what about arrays where there are no dips? The code returns True.               #           #         # What about arrays with exactly one dip, but modifying either i or i+1 leads to a valid array.               #           #         # The code handles that.               #           #         # So this code should be correct.               #           #         # Now, the problem is to write this code in Python efficiently.               #           #         # However, the code makes copies of the array, which could be optimized.               #           #         # But given time constraints, perhaps this is acceptable.               #           #         # So the code would be as follows.               #           #         # Edge cases to consider: when the array has one element (return True), when the array is already non-decreasing (return True), when the array has two elements (e.g., [2,1], return True).               #           #         # Let's code this.               #           #         # But the code may have some redundancy. For example, when i is 0 and option1 is to modify nums[0], and the code creates a copy and checks.               #           #         # Let's proceed.               #           #         # Also, in Python, the list slicing and copying can be optimized.               #           #         # But for the purpose of this problem, let's proceed.               #           #         # Now, the code.               #           #         # But wait, the code as outlined earlier has a loop for each dip, but in code, the loop is written as for i in range(len(nums)-1), and when a dip is found, it checks options and returns immediately.               #           #         # For example, the code after the first dip returns True if either option is valid, else returns False.               #           #         # But what about the rest of the array after the dip?               #           #         # For example, in array [1,2,5,3,4,6], the dip is at i=2 (5>3). Option1: modify 5 to3, array becomes [1,2,3,3,4,6], which is valid. So code returns True.               #           #         # But the code would return True right after processing the first dip, without checking the rest of the array.               #           #         # Wait, no.

But for the problem's constraints, this should be acceptable.               #           #         # So the code passes all test cases.               #           #         # Now, let's test this code with the example where modifying a dip introduces another dip earlier in the array.               #           #         # For example, the array [3,4,2,3] has a dip at i=1. option1: modifying 4 to 2 creates [3,2,2,3]. The code checks the entire array and finds 3>2, so valid1 is False. option2: modify 2 to4. array becomes [3,4,4,3]. The code checks and finds 4>3 at the end. So valid2 is False. So code returns False.

A non-decreasing array is defined as one where each element is less than or equal to the next element.

When a dip is found, we consider two possible modifications to fix the array:1. Modify the current element to be equal to the next element.2. Modify the next element to be equal to the current element.For each modification, we check if the resulting array becomes non-decreasing.

I need to write a Python function called isPrefixOfWord that takes a sentence and a searchWord, and returns the 1-based index of the first word in the sentence where the searchWord is a prefix. If none, return -1.Hmm, first, I need to split the sentence into words. Oh right, the words are separated by a single space, so splitting on spaces should work. So split the sentence into a list of words using .split().Wait, but what if there are multiple spaces? Oh, the problem says the sentence consists of words separated by a single space, so no worries there. So splitting by space will get all the words correctly.Once I have the list of words, I need to check each word in order, starting from the first, to see if the searchWord is a prefix of that word. As soon as I find the first occurrence, return its 1-based index. If none, return -1.So the steps are:1. Split the sentence into words.2. Iterate over each word in the list, keeping track of their 1-based index.3. For each word, check if it starts with the searchWord.   - How to check that? Using the string method .startswith() maybe. Yes.4. The first word that satisfies this condition, return its index.5. If none found after checking all, return -1.But wait, what about the case where the searchWord is longer than the word? Like, if the word is \\"burg\\" and searchWord is \\"burger\\"? Wait no, the problem says that the searchWord is a prefix of the word. So the word must be at least as long as the searchWord. So for example, if the word is \\"bu\\" and searchWord is \\"bur\\", then the word is too short, so it's not a prefix.So in the check, we can first check if the length of the word is >= length of searchWord. Then check if the substring of the word up to the length of searchWord matches.Alternatively, the .startswith() method would handle that, right? Because if the word is shorter than the searchWord, then word.startswith(searchWord) would automatically return False. Because you can't start with a longer string.Yes. So, for example, if the word is 'a' and the searchWord is 'ab', then 'a'.startswith('ab') is False. So using .startswith() is sufficient.So the steps can be:Loop through each word in the split list, in order. For each word, check if word.startswith(searchWord). If yes, return the index (1-based). Otherwise, proceed. If none found, return -1.So code-wise, split the sentence into words with words = sentence.split(). Then for index, word in enumerate(words, start=1). Then check if word.startswith(searchWord). Return index on first match. Else, after loop, return -1.Wait, but in Python, the enumerate starts from 0 by default, but since we need 1-based index, we can set start=1. So that's correct.So the code would be something like:def isPrefixOfWord(self, sentence: str, searchWord: str) -> int:    words = sentence.split()    for idx, word in enumerate(words, 1):        if word.startswith(searchWord):            return idx    return -1But wait, let's test the examples.Example 1: sentence is \\"i love eating burger\\", split into [\\"i\\", \\"love\\", \\"eating\\", \\"burger\\"]. Check each for starting with \\"burg\\". The fourth word is \\"burger\\", which starts with \\"burg\\" (since \\"burger\\" starts with \\"burg\\"). So returns 4. Correct.Example 2: sentence is \\"this problem is an easy problem\\", searchWord is \\"pro\\". Split into [\\"this\\", \\"problem\\", ...]. The second word is \\"problem\\", which starts with \\"pro\\". So returns 2. Correct.Example 3: words are \\"i\\", \\"am\\", \\"tired\\". None starts with \\"you\\", so returns -1.Example 4: sentence \\"i use triple pillow\\" split into [\\"i\\", \\"use\\", \\"triple\\", \\"pillow\\"]. searchWord is \\"pill\\". The fourth word is \\"pillow\\", which starts with \\"pill\\"? Wait, \\"pillow\\" starts with 'pill' (p-i-l-l). Yes. So returns 4. Correct.Example 5: \\"hello from the other side\\" split into words. None start with \\"they\\". So returns -1.So all examples are covered. What about edge cases?Edge case 1: searchWord is longer than some words. For example, sentence is \\"a aa aaa\\", searchWord is \\"aaaa\\". Then, all words are shorter than the searchWord, so startswith would return False. So returns -1.Another edge case: the searchWord is exactly a word. Like sentence is \\"apple app app\\", searchWord is \\"app\\". The first occurrence is index 2 (the second word \\"app\\")? Wait, no. Let's see. Wait, the words are [\\"apple\\", \\"app\\", \\"app\\"]. The first word is \\"apple\\" which starts with \\"app\\"? Because \\"apple\\" starts with \\"app\\" (the first three letters). So the first occurrence is the first word? So if the searchWord is \\"app\\", then the first word is \\"apple\\", which starts with \\"app\\". So the index would be 1. So in the example, if the searchWord is \\"app\\", the code would return 1, not 2.Yes. Because the first word is checked first. So the code correctly returns the earliest occurrence.Another case: searchWord is empty? But according to constraints, the searchWord has length >=1. So no need to handle that.Another case: sentence is one word. Like \\"hello\\", searchWord is \\"he\\". Then returns 1.Yes. So code seems to handle that.So the code should be correct. Now, implementing that in Python.So the function is as written above. The code seems straightforward. Let's see the constraints. The code splits the sentence into words, which is O(n) time, then iterates through each word. Each startswith check is O(k), where k is the length of the searchWord. Since the maximum length of the sentence is 100, and the searchWord is up to 10 characters, this is acceptable.So this should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given search word is a prefix of any word in a sentence.

For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to reverse the digits of a 32-bit signed integer. Let's think about how to approach this. Hmm, let's start with some examples. Like for 123, the reverse is 321. For -123, it's -321. And 120 becomes 21, dropping the leading zero. Also, if the reversed number is outside the 32-bit range, return 0.First, I need to handle negative numbers. Maybe take the absolute value first, reverse the digits, then reapply the sign. That makes sense. So the steps could be:1. Check if the number is negative. If yes, remember the sign and work with the absolute value.2. Reverse the digits of the absolute value.3. Apply the sign back.4. Check if the reversed number is within the 32-bit range. If not, return 0.But how to reverse the digits? Let's think. For example, take 123. We can extract each digit starting from the end. Let's see:123 % 10 gives 3. Then 123 // 10 is 12. Next, 12%10 is 2, 12//10 is 1. Then 1%10 is 1, 1//10 is 0. So we can loop until the number becomes zero.So, the reversing process can be done by:- Initialize reversed_num to 0.- While the original number (absolute) is greater than 0:   - Take the last digit using mod 10.   - Multiply reversed_num by 10 and add the digit.   - Divide the original number by 10 (integer division).Wait, but the original number is being modified each time. So yes, that's the standard way to reverse digits.Now, handling the sign. Let's say x is negative. We take abs(x), reverse it, then multiply by -1. But before that, need to check the overflow after applying the sign.But what about the overflow during the reversing process? Because when reversing, even if the original x is within 32-bit, the reversed number might exceed. So during each step of building reversed_num, we need to check if adding the next digit would cause it to go beyond the 32-bit range.Wait, the 32-bit signed integer range is from -2^31 to 2^31 -1. So the maximum positive value is 2147483647. The minimum is -2147483648.So after reversing, if the number is positive, check if it's larger than 2^31-1. If yes, return 0. If negative, check if it's less than -2^31. Then return 0.But how to check for overflow during the reversal process? Let's think. For example, if the reversed number is building up and exceeds the 32-bit limit before adding the next digit. Because once reversed_num is multiplied by 10, adding a digit (like 7) could push it over.Wait, maybe during each step of the loop, before multiplying reversed_num by 10 and adding the digit, check if reversed_num would exceed the max after this step.But how?The max allowed value for a positive reversed_num is 2147483647. Let's see. For example, if reversed_num is 214748364, then multiplying by 10 gives 2147483640. Then adding the next digit. Suppose the next digit is 8. Then 2147483640 +8 = 2147483648. Which is over the max. So we need to check before doing that.So during each iteration, after getting the digit, check if reversed_num > (max_int // 10) or reversed_num == (max_int //10) and digit > (max_int %10). If so, return 0.Similarly for the negative case, but since we're working with absolute value first, maybe handle the check based on the sign.Wait, but during the reversal process, we're working with the absolute value. So reversed_num is positive. So, if during reversal, the reversed_num exceeds 2^31-1, then after applying the sign, it would be either over the max or min.So maybe during the reversal steps, check if the current reversed_num is going to overflow when the next step is applied. Let's see:For example, the maximum allowed is 2147483647. So during the loop, when building reversed_num:At each step, reversed_num = reversed_num *10 + digit.If reversed_num > (max_int //10), then multiplying by 10 would make reversed_num*10 > max_int (since max_int//10 is 214748364, and 214748364*10=2147483640, but if reversed_num is 214748365, then 214748365 *10 is 2147483650 which is larger than max_int 2147483647. So in that case, even before adding the digit, reversed_num*10 is already over the limit, so return 0.Alternatively, if reversed_num is exactly equal to max_int//10 (214748364), then the next digit can't be more than 7 (since 2147483647's last digit is 7). So if the next digit is 8, then 214748364*10 +8 = 2147483648 which is over.So during the loop, after extracting the digit from x, before updating reversed_num, check:if reversed_num > max_int //10 or (reversed_num == max_int//10 and digit > max_int %10):then return 0.But wait, the max_int is 2^31-1 which is 2147483647. So max_int//10 is 214748364, max_int%10 is7.So during the loop:if reversed_num > 214748364 → overflow when multiply by 10.Or if reversed_num == 214748364 and digit>7 → overflow.Similarly, if the original number is negative, the reversed_num after applying the sign would be -reversed_num. The min is -2147483648. So when reversed_num is 2147483648, then after applying the negative sign, it's -2147483648 which is exactly the min. But wait, if reversed_num is 2147483648, then when the original x was negative, the reversed_num is 2147483648. Then with the sign applied, it's -2147483648. Which is exactly the lower bound. So in that case, it's allowed. Wait, but 2147483648 is 2^31, which is one more than 2^31-1. So the min is -2^31, which is -2147483648. So for example, if the reversed number is 2147483648, and the original x was negative, then the reversed number would be -2147483648, which is exactly the lower bound, so allowed.Wait, but how can reversed_num be 2147483648 during the process? Because when x is negative, we take abs(x), reverse it, then apply sign. So if abs(x) reversed is 2147483648, then the number is -2147483648, which is within the allowed range.Wait, but 2147483648 is 2^31, which is beyond the 32-bit signed integer range. So even if the reversed_num is 2147483648, which is 2^31, then when the original x is negative, the result is -2147483648, which is exactly the minimum value. So in that case, the reversed_num is 2147483648, but the actual result is allowed.Hmm, so perhaps the check during reversal should be different depending on whether the original number was negative or positive.Alternatively, perhaps the check during reversal should be:For positive numbers:After reversal, reversed_num must be <= 2147483647.For negative numbers:After reversal, reversed_num must be <= 2147483648 (since applying the negative gives -reversed_num, which would be >= -2147483648).Wait, but during the reversal process, we're working with the absolute value of x. So the reversed_num is positive. Then, after reversing, if x was negative, the final number is -reversed_num. So the reversed_num can be up to 2147483648 (so that -reversed_num is -2147483648, which is allowed). But if reversed_num is 2147483649, then applying the sign gives -2147483649, which is below the minimum.So the check during reversal for the negative case is that reversed_num <= 2147483648.But how to handle this in the code.Alternatively, perhaps during the reversal process, we can check for both possible overflows. Because:If the original x is positive:After reversal, reversed_num must be <= 2147483647.If original x is negative:After reversal, reversed_num must be <= 2147483648. Because then the final result is -reversed_num, which can be as low as -2147483648.But how to track that during the reversal process.Hmm. Maybe the approach is to first reverse the digits as a positive number, then check if the sign is positive and reversed_num exceeds 2^31-1, or sign is negative and reversed_num exceeds 2^31. If so, return 0. Otherwise, return the reversed_num with the sign applied.So the steps would be:1. Check if x is negative. If yes, sign is -1, else 1.2. Take absolute value of x.3. Reverse the digits of the absolute value.4. Check if reversed_num exceeds the 32-bit range based on the sign.   - If sign is 1 and reversed_num > 2^31 -1 → return 0.   - If sign is -1 and reversed_num > 2^31 → return 0.   - Else, return reversed_num * sign.But how to reverse the digits and build reversed_num.But then, during reversing, the reversed_num could be built in a way that even before completing, it's already exceeding the possible limits. For example, if the original number is 2147483647 reversed is 7463847412, which is way over. But during the reversal steps, we can check if building the reversed_num would cause overflow. But how?Wait, but the code can reverse the digits first, then check the overflow. However, if during the reversal process, the reversed_num becomes larger than 2^31 (which is 2147483648) even for positive numbers, but after applying the sign, it's beyond the 32-bit range, then the code would return 0. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so even if during reversal, reversed_num is a big number, the code can check after reversing.But wait, but if x is a 32-bit integer, then its reversed number could be up to 10^9 digits, which when stored as a Python integer can be handled. So, the code can proceed as:- Reverse the digits as a positive integer, then check if it's beyond the allowed range (considering the sign), and return 0 if so.But how to reverse the digits?Let me think of code steps.First, handle the sign. Then reverse the digits.For example:def reverse(x: int) -> int:    sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1    x_abs = abs(x)    reversed_num = 0    while x_abs > 0:        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + x_abs %10        x_abs = x_abs //10    reversed_num *= sign    if reversed_num < -231 or reversed_num > 231 -1:        return 0    return reversed_numWait, but what about x=0? The loop would not run, reversed_num is 0, then 0 is returned.Test case 3: 120 → reversed_num is 021 → but since x_abs is 120, reversing:Loop steps:x_abs = 120 → 120%10 is 0. reversed_num becomes 0. x_abs becomes 12.x_abs=12 → 12%10=2. reversed_num 0*10+2=2. x_abs=1.x_abs=1 → 1%10=1. reversed_num 2*10+1=21. x_abs=0. So reversed_num is 21, multiplied by sign (positive) → 21. Which is correct.But in the code above, after reversing, we check if reversed_num is outside the 32-bit range. So for example, if the reversed_num is 2147483648 (which is 2^31), then for a positive x, the code returns 0. But for a negative x, the reversed_num is 2147483648, multiplied by sign -1 gives -2147483648, which is exactly the lower bound. So in that case, the code would return -2147483648. But according to the problem statement, if the reversed integer overflows, return 0. But wait, the problem says that the function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows. So in the case where reversed_num is 2147483648, if x was negative, then the result is -2147483648, which is within the allowed range. So the code's check is incorrect.Because the code checks reversed_num after applying the sign. So in that case:reversed_num = 2147483648 → sign is -1 → reversed_num * sign is -2147483648.Check if it is < -2^31 → -2147483648 is equal to -2^31. So it's allowed. So the code would not return 0.But according to the problem's note, when the reversed integer overflows, return 0. So, the code's current approach is incorrect. Because when the reversed_num is 2147483648 and the sign is -1, the final result is -2^31, which is allowed. So the code's check is correct.Wait, the code's check is:if reversed_num < -231 or reversed_num > 231 -1 → return 0.So for example, if reversed_num after applying the sign is -2147483648, it's exactly equal to -231. So the condition is false. So the code returns -2147483648.Which is correct.But what about a reversed_num of 2147483648 (2^31) when the sign is positive. Then, after applying sign, the result is 2147483648, which is larger than 2^31-1 (2147483647). So the code returns 0.So the code's check seems to work.But the code as written may have an issue during the reversing process. Because during the reversal, the reversed_num could be built correctly even for numbers that when multiplied by 10 and added digits would exceed 32 bits. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so even if the reversed_num is 10^18, Python can handle it. Then, after reversing, the code checks if it's within the range.But in other programming languages like Java or C++, this could cause integer overflow during the reversal process, leading to incorrect reversed numbers. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so building reversed_num as a large integer and then checking if it's within the 32-bit range is possible.But wait, the problem's note says: \\"Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range\\". So perhaps even during the reversal process, we need to prevent the reversed_num from going beyond 32 bits. But how?Wait, the note says that if the reversed integer overflows, return 0. So regardless of how it's handled during the reversal steps, the final reversed number after applying the sign must be checked.But what if during the reversal steps, the reversed_num becomes larger than 2^31-1 even before the loop ends? For example, the original x is 1534236469. Reversed is 9646324351, which is way beyond 2^31-1. So the code would reverse all digits, then check and return 0.But during the reversal steps, the code builds reversed_num as 9646324351, which is a Python integer. Then, the code checks if it's within the 32-bit range. Since it's not, returns 0.So the code would work correctly in that case.But what about in the case where during the reversal steps, the reversed_num exceeds 2^31-1 even before the loop completes. For example, when building reversed_num, after some steps, reversed_num is already 214748365. Then, when multiplied by 10, it becomes 2147483650, which is over the 32-bit limit. But in Python, this is allowed. The code would proceed to add the next digit. So the reversed_num can become very big. Then, after the loop, the code checks and returns 0.But in other programming languages, this would cause integer overflow, leading to incorrect reversed_num. But in Python, integers can be as large as needed.So the code as written is correct for Python.But perhaps the problem expects us to check during reversal steps to prevent overflow. For example, if during reversing, the reversed_num would exceed 32 bits, return 0 even before completing the reversal.But how to do that in Python?Because Python can handle big numbers, so during the reversal steps, reversed_num can be 10^100. Then, after reversing, the code checks and returns 0.But let's think about the problem's note. It says that the environment can only store integers within the 32-bit range. So perhaps the code needs to simulate that. For example, even if during reversal steps, the reversed_num exceeds 32 bits, the code should return 0.Wait, but the problem's note says to return 0 if the reversed integer overflows. So it's the final reversed number that's checked, not the intermediate steps.So the code's approach is correct.But let's test some cases.Test case 1: x = 123 → reversed_num is 321 → 321 is within range → return 321.Test case 2: x = -123 → reversed_num during reversal is 321, multiplied by sign → -321 → within range.Test case 3: x=120 → reversed_num 21 → correct.Another test case: x= 2147483647 → reversed is 7463847412 → which is way larger than 2^31-1 → returns 0.Another test case: x= -2147483648. The absolute value is 2147483648. Reverse digits: 8463847412 → then multiplied by -1 → -8463847412 → which is less than -2^31 → return 0.But wait, in Python, the code would reverse 2147483648 into 8463847412 (wait, no. Let's compute:x_abs = 2147483648 → let's reverse the digits.But 2147483648 is 2,147,483,648 → reversed is 8463847412.But 8463847412 is larger than 2^31-1 (2147483647). So reversed_num * sign is -8463847412 → which is less than -2^31 → return 0.But according to the code, after reversing, the code checks if reversed_num * sign is within the range. So yes, returns 0.Another test case: x = -2147483412 → reversing the absolute value (2147483412). The reversed is 2143847412. Then multiplied by -1 → -2143847412. The lower bound is -2147483648. So -2143847412 is larger than that. So it's within the range. So code returns -2143847412.But wait, the reversed of 2147483412 is 2143847412? Let's compute:Original number: 2147483412.Reversed digits: 2143847412.Yes, because the original number is 2,1,4,7,4,8,3,4,1,2 → reversed is 2,1,4,3,8,4,7,4,1,2 → 2143847412.So code returns -2143847412, which is within -2^31 (which is -2147483648). So yes, allowed.Another test case: x = 1534236469 → reversed is 9646324351 → which is over 2^31-1 (2147483647). So code returns 0.So the code seems to handle these cases.But wait, in the code, reversed_num is built as a positive number. Then multiplied by sign.Then the code checks if the final reversed_num is within the allowed range.So the code is correct.But wait, in the code:After reversing, reversed_num is built as the reversed of x_abs. Then multiplied by sign.Then check if reversed_num is within [-2^31, 2^31-1].Yes.So code seems correct.But in Python, the code as written would return 0 for reversed_num that's outside the range. Let's see.But the code may have a problem with the reversed_num during building. For example, if x_abs is 1999999999. Reversed is 9999999991. Then 9999999991 is larger than 2^31-1 (2147483647). So code returns 0.Yes.But during the loop, the code builds reversed_num as 9999999991, which is correct. Then the code checks and returns 0.So code works.But let's test the case where x is -2147483648. The absolute value is 2147483648. Reversed is 8463847412. multiplied by -1 → -8463847412. Check if this is less than -2^31 → -8463847412 is less than -2147483648 → yes. So code returns 0.Which is correct.So the code seems to handle all cases correctly.But wait, what about x=0? The code returns 0, which is correct.Another test case: x=1 → returns 1.Another case: x= 2147483647 → reversed is 7463847412 → which is 7463847412 → which is larger than 2147483647 → code returns 0.So yes.Thus, the code as written seems to be correct.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to reverse the digits of a 32-bit signed integer and return 0 if the reversed integer overflows the 32-bit signed integer range, which is from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1. Approach1. Handle Sign: Determine the sign of the input integer and work with its absolute value to simplify the reversal process.2. Reverse Digits: Reverse the digits of the absolute value of the integer. This is done by repeatedly extracting the last digit of the number and building the reversed number.3. Check Overflow: After reversing the digits, check if the resulting integer, when adjusted for the original sign, falls within the 32-bit signed integer range. If it does not, return 0.

Sign Handling: The sign of the input integer is stored, and the absolute value is used for reversing the digits. This simplifies the reversal process as we only deal with positive numbers.2. Digit Reversal: Using a loop, the digits of the absolute value are reversed. In each iteration, the last digit of the current number is extracted using modulus 10, and this digit is added to the reversed number after multiplying the reversed number by 10 (to shift its digits left). The original number is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.3. Overflow Check: After reversing the digits, the result is adjusted for the original sign. We then check if this result is within the 32-bit signed integer range. If it is outside this range, 0 is returned; otherwise, the reversed integer is returned.This approach ensures that we handle both positive and negative integers correctly and efficiently check for overflow after reversing the digits."},{"problem":"The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:1.     12.     113.     214.     12115.     1112211 is read off as \\"one 1\\" or 11.11 is read off as \\"two 1s\\" or 21.21 is read off as \\"one 2, then one 1\\" or 1211.Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.Example 1:Input: 1Output: \\"1\\"Example 2:Input: 4Output: \\"1211\\"","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to generate the nth term in the count-and-say sequence. Let me think about how this sequence works. First, the examples given. The first term is \\"1\\". Then each subsequent term is generated by describing the previous term. Like, the second term is \\"11\\" because the first term is one 1. The third term is \\"21\\" because the second term is two 1s. Then the fourth term is \\"1211\\" which is one 2 and one 1. And so on. So each step involves reading the previous string and converting it into counts followed by the digits.So the problem is, given n, return the nth term as a string. How to approach this?Hmm. Let's think about the base case first. If n is 1, return \\"1\\". For n greater than 1, we need to compute each term step by step up to n.The main challenge is to generate each term based on the previous one. For each term, starting from the first, we need to generate the next term by counting the consecutive digits and then saying them.So the plan is: start with the initial term \\"1\\", then for each step from 2 to n, generate the next term by processing the current term.How to process the current term to get the next one?Let's take an example. Let's say the current term is \\"21\\". We need to read this as \\"one 2 followed by one 1\\", which becomes \\"1211\\".So the process is to iterate through the string, group consecutive identical digits, count the length of the group, then append the count followed by the digit.So for a given string s, the next string is built by:Initialize a result string, maybe as a list for efficiency.Then, iterate through s, tracking the current digit and its count.Start with the first character, count = 1. Then for each next character, if it's the same as current, increment count. Otherwise, append the count and current digit to the result, then reset current to the new digit and count to 1. After the loop ends, append the last count and digit.So for each term, we generate the next term using this process.So the algorithm would be:Initialize the sequence with the first term as \\"1\\".For each i from 2 to n:    Generate the next term by processing the current term.So the steps for the function:If n is 1, return \\"1\\".Else, for each step from 2 to n, generate the next term.How to implement this in Python?Let's think about writing a loop that builds each term step by step.Let's start with current_str = \\"1\\".Then, for i in range(2, n+1):    current_str = get_next_term(current_str)The get_next_term function would take a string and return the next term.Implementing get_next_term:def get_next_term(s):    result = []    current_char = s[0]    count = 1    for char in s[1:]:        if char == current_char:            count +=1        else:            result.append(str(count) + current_char)            current_char = char            count = 1    # after loop, append the remaining    result.append(str(count) + current_char)    return ''.join(result)Yes, that makes sense. So for each term, this function would process it and build the next one.So putting this together in the countAndSay method:The base case is when n is 1. For n >=1, the function starts with \\"1\\" and iterates n-1 times.Wait, for n=1, return \\"1\\". For n=2, iterate once. So the loop runs from 1 to n-1 times.Wait, in the code, the initial current_str is \\"1\\". Then for n steps, we need to loop (n-1) times. Because for example, if n is 4, the steps are:1: initial \\"1\\"2: after first iteration (i=2) → \\"11\\"3: after second (i=3) → \\"21\\"4: after third (i=4) → \\"1211\\"So yes, for n=4, the loop runs from 2 to 4 (3 iterations), which is correct.So the code would be:if n == 0: return \\"\\" (though problem says n is integer, maybe assume n >=1)current_str = \\"1\\"for _ in range(n-1):    current_str = get_next_term(current_str)return current_strSo integrating all this into the Solution class.Now, implement the get_next_term as part of the function. Since it's a helper function, perhaps inline it within the loop.So the code would be:class Solution:    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:        if n == 1:            return \\"1\\"        current_str = \\"1\\"        for _ in range(n-1):            next_str = []            current_char = current_str[0]            count = 1            for char in current_str[1:]:                if char == current_char:                    count +=1                else:                    next_str.append(str(count) + current_char)                    current_char = char                    count = 1            # append the last counted part            next_str.append(str(count) + current_char)            current_str = ''.join(next_str)        return current_strWait, let's test this code with the examples.Example 1: n=1 → returns \\"1\\". Correct.Example 2: n=4. Let's see:Loop runs for 3 times (since n-1=3).Initial current_str is \\"1\\".First iteration (n=2):current_str is \\"1\\".Processing:current_char is '1', count=1. No other chars. So append \\"1\\" + \\"1\\" → \\"11\\".current_str becomes \\"11\\".Second iteration (n=3):Processing \\"11\\".current_char '1', count starts at 1. Next char is '1', so count becomes 2. Then loop ends. Append \\"21\\". current_str is \\"21\\".Third iteration (n=4):Processing \\"21\\".First char is '2', next is '1'. So first, check '2' vs '1' → not same. So append \\"12\\" (count 1, char 2). Then current_char becomes '1', count 1. Then loop ends. Append \\"11\\". So next_str is \\"12\\"+\\"11\\" → \\"1211\\". Which is the correct output for n=4. So yes.Another example, n=5:After n=4 is \\"1211\\". Next iteration:Processing \\"1211\\".current_char is '1', count=1.Next char is '2': different. Append \\"11\\" → next_str has [\\"11\\"]. Then current_char is '2', count=1. Next char is '1': different. Append \\"12\\" → next_str is [\\"11\\", \\"12\\"]. current_char becomes '1', count=1. Next char is '1': same. count becomes 2. Loop ends. Append \\"21\\". So next_str is \\"11\\" + \\"12\\" + \\"21\\" → \\"111221\\". Which matches the example for n=5.So the code seems correct.But what about when the input is 0? The problem states that n is an integer, but perhaps the constraints say n >=1. The examples start at 1. So in the code, the initial check for n=1 is correct.So this code should work.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. The count-and-say sequence is a series of numbers where each term is generated by describing the digits of the previous term.  Approach1. Understanding the Sequence: The sequence starts with \\"1\\". Each subsequent term is formed by counting the number of consecutive digits in the previous term and then combining these counts with the digits themselves.2.

Efficient String Handling: Using a list to build each term efficiently, as string concatenation in loops can be inefficient.

Base Case Handling: If \`n\` is 1, the result is directly \\"1\\".2. Iterative Term Generation: Starting from the initial term \\"1\\", iterate \`n-1\` times to generate each subsequent term.3. String Processing: For each term, traverse its characters, count consecutive occurrences, and build the next term using a list for efficiency. This avoids the overhead of repeated string concatenation.4. Constructing the Next Term: After processing all characters of the current term, the final count and character are appended to the result list, which is then joined into a string to form the next term.This approach ensures that each term is generated efficiently, with a time complexity of O(n * m), where m is the average length of the terms, and a space complexity of O(m) to store the current and next terms."},{"problem":"Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.Example 1:Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]Output: 2Explanation: The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.Of the subarrays that have the same degree:[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]The shortest length is 2.

Let's start by understanding the problem properly.The degree of the array is the maximum frequency of any element. So, first, I need to find out which elements are the most frequent. Then, for each of those elements, I need to find the shortest subarray that contains all their occurrences. Because the subarray has to be contiguous, the shortest length for such an element would be the distance between the first and last occurrence of that element plus one (since indices are zero-based). Then among all these elements with maximum frequency, I pick the one with the smallest such length. If there are multiple elements with the same maximum frequency, I have to choose the smallest length among all their possible subarrays.Let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I need to calculate the frequency of each element. That's straightforward. I can use a dictionary to count occurrences.Then, I need to determine the maximum frequency, which is the degree of the array.Once I have the elements that have this maximum frequency, for each of them, I need to find the first and last index where they appear. The difference between these indices plus one gives the length of the subarray. The smallest such length across all these elements is the answer.So, the steps are:1. Create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each element.2. Find the maximum frequency (degree).3. Collect all elements that have this maximum frequency.4. For each such element, find the first and last occurrence indices.5. Calculate the subarray length for each element (last - first + 1).6. The minimum of these lengths is the answer.Now, how to track the first and last occurrence for each element?I can create two dictionaries: one for the first occurrence and one for the last occurrence. As I iterate through the array, for each element, if it's the first time we see it, record the index in the first occurrence dict. Then, for every occurrence, update the last occurrence dict to the current index. That way, after processing the array, each element's first and last positions are known.So, let's outline the steps in code:- Initialize frequency dictionary, first_occurrence, last_occurrence.- Iterate through nums with their indices.- For each num in nums:   - If num not in first_occurrence, set first_occurrence[num] = current index.   - Update last_occurrence[num] to current index.   - Increment frequency count for num.- Find the maximum frequency (degree).- Collect all elements with this frequency.- For each element in this list, compute last_occurrence[element] - first_occurrence[element] + 1.- Find the minimum value among these.That makes sense. Now, let's think about possible edge cases.For example, if the array has all elements the same. Like [2,2,2,2]. Then the maximum frequency is 4, and the subarray is the entire array, so length is 4.Another case: elements with the same frequency. Like example 1, where 1 and 2 both appear twice. For 1, the first occurrence is index 0, last is 4. Length is 5. For 2, first is 1, last is 2. Length is 2. So the answer is 2.So the code should handle these cases correctly.Now, let's code this step by step.First, the frequency dictionary. Python's defaultdict can be used here. Or a regular dictionary, initializing counts.Similarly, for the first and last occurrences. The first time a number is seen, first_occurrence is set. The last_occurrence is updated every time the number is encountered.So code outline:from collections import defaultdictdef findShortestSubArray(nums):    # Initialize the dictionaries    freq = defaultdict(int)    first = {}    last = {}        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):        if num not in first:            first[num] = idx        last[num] = idx        freq[num] += 1        # Find the maximum frequency    max_freq = max(freq.values())        # Find all elements with max_freq    candidates = [num for num, count in freq.items() if count == max_freq]        # Calculate the minimal length    min_length = float('inf')    for num in candidates:        length = last[num] - first[num] + 1        if length < min_length:            min_length = length        return min_lengthWait, that's the logic. Let's test this code against the examples.Example 1: [1,2,2,3,1]Frequency counts:1: 22: 23:1first_occurrence for 1 is 0, last is 4.For 2, first is 1, last is 2.So candidates are 1 and 2. Their lengths are 5-0+1=5 (wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, last[num] for 1 is index 4. 4 -0 +1 =5. For 2, 2-1+1=2. So the minimum is 2. Correct. So the code returns 2. Which matches the example.Example 2: [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]Let's see. The elements:1 occurs at 0,4 → count 22 occurs at 1,2,6 → count 33: count 14: count 1So max_freq is 3 (for 2). The first occurrence is 1, last is 6. So 6-1+1 =6. So the output is 6. Which matches the example.Another test case: [1]. The frequency is 1. The subarray is length 1. Correct.Another test case: [2,2,2]. Max_freq 3. first 0, last 2. Length 3. So code returns 3.So this code seems correct.Now, considering the constraints. The array can be up to 50,000 elements. The code iterates through the array once, which is O(n) time. The space is O(n) for the dictionaries, which should be acceptable.I think this should work. Let's write the code accordingly.

Note:Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to find the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence in an unsorted array of integers. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.So, the problem is about finding the longest subarray where each element is strictly larger than the previous one. Right, because it's continuous, the elements have to be consecutive in the original array. Like in example 1, even though there's a longer increasing sequence when skipping elements, the continuous one is shorter but required to be consecutive.Let's start by understanding the examples. In the first example, [1,3,5,4,7], the longest continuous is [1,3,5], length 3. Then after 5 comes 4, which is smaller, so the current sequence breaks. Then 4 to 7 is increasing again, so that's a sequence of length 2. But the maximum is 3.In the second example, all elements are the same. So each individual element is a subsequence of length 1, so the maximum is 1.So the approach must track sequences where each next element is larger than the previous. Whenever that's not the case, we reset the current count.So here's the plan: iterate through the array, keeping track of the current length of the increasing subsequence. Whenever the next element is larger than the current, we increase the current length. If not, we reset the current length to 1 (since the next element starts a new potential sequence). Also, keep track of the maximum length found so far.Wait, but what about when the array is empty? Oh, the note says the array's length won't exceed 10,000, but what if it's zero? Well, according to the problem's examples, maybe the function should return 0 for an empty input. But the problem statement's examples start with non-empty arrays. Let's check the constraints again. The note says the length won't exceed 10,000, but maybe the function is intended to handle empty arrays. Hmm. Let's see. The problem says \\"unsorted array of integers\\"—so if the array is empty, the longest is zero. So in code, we need to handle that case.But first, let's outline the steps.Initialize max_length and current_length. For example, if the array is empty, return 0. Otherwise, start current_length at 1, and max_length at 1.Then, iterate from the second element (index 1) to the end. For each element, compare it to the previous one. If it's larger, increment current_length by 1. Else, reset current_length to 1. After each step, update max_length if current_length is greater than max_length.Yes, that sounds right.Let's test this approach against the examples.Example 1: [1,3,5,4,7]Initialization: current =1, max=1.Index 1 (3 >1): current=2, max=2.Index 2 (5>3): current=3, max=3.Index3 (4 <5): reset current to 1. Max remains 3.Index4 (7>4): current=2. Max is still 3.Final answer is 3. Correct.Example 2: [2,2,2,2,2]Initialization: current=1, max=1.Each next element is not larger, so current resets to 1 each time. So max stays 1.Another test case: [1,2,3,2,3,4,5]. The longest is 4 (2,3,4,5). Let's see.Initial current and max are 1.Index1: 2>1 → current 2, max 2.Index2:3>2 → current3, max3.Index3:2 <3 → reset to 1. Max3.Index4:3>2 → current2. Max3.Index5:4>3 → current3. Max3.Index6:5>4 → current4. Max becomes4.Yes, correct.What about an array with one element? Like [5]. Should return 1. Which the code would handle, since current and max start at 1.Edge case: empty array. Should return 0. So in code, first check if the array is empty. If yes, return 0. Otherwise proceed.So, code structure:Function takes nums as input. If not nums, return 0.Else, initialize current_length = 1, max_length =1.Loop from i=1 to len(nums)-1:if nums[i] > nums[i-1], then current_length +=1. Else, current_length =1.Then, update max_length if current_length is larger.At the end, return max_length.Yes, that's straightforward.Now, converting this into Python code.The code should be inside the Solution class's method.So, code:class Solution:    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        if not nums:            return 0        max_length = 1        current_length = 1        for i in range(1, len(nums)):            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:                current_length +=1                if current_length > max_length:                    max_length = current_length            else:                current_length = 1        return max_lengthWait, but in the code, after updating current_length, we check if it's greater than max_length. Alternatively, in each step, after changing current_length, compare and update max_length. Because even in the case where current_length increases, we need to check if it's now the max. For example, in a strictly increasing array, the max is updated each step.So, in the code, after incrementing current_length (if nums[i] > previous), then check if it's larger than max. But in the code above, that's done inside the 'if' clause. Wait, for example:If the current_length increases to 3, then we check if it's larger than max and update. That's correct.Alternatively, we can compute max_length every time, regardless of whether the current step was an increase or a reset. Because even when resetting, the max_length might already be the maximum. But in the code as written, the max is updated only when current_length increases. However, that's not correct. Because when we reset current_length to 1, the previous max might be the maximum. But in the code above, the 'else' clause does not update max_length. However, in the code, after each iteration, regardless of whether we are in an increasing step or a reset step, the code checks whether the current_length is bigger than max_length. Wait no. Let's see.Wait, in the code as written, in the 'if nums[i] > nums[i-1]' case, current_length increases, and then we check if current_length is now larger than max_length. If yes, update.In the else case, current_length is set to 1, but there's no check here. But after that, in the next iteration, when the code proceeds, the check only happens when the next element is increasing.Wait, this is a mistake. Because in the else case, after resetting current_length to 1, the max_length is not being checked. But when the array is like [4,3,2,1], then each step after the first is a reset. The initial max_length is 1, which is correct. But during each iteration, after resetting current_length to 1, we don't compare to max_length, which is already 1. So the code is correct.Wait, but in the case where the current_length is reset to 1, which is equal to the max_length. So no need to update. So the code is correct.But wait, what if all elements are 1 except the last one which is 2. For example, [1,1,1,1,2]. Then the steps would be:current starts at 1.i=1: 1 not >1 → reset to 1. Max remains 1.i=2: same → current 1.i=3: same → current 1.i=4: 2>1 → current becomes 2. Then compare to max (1), so max becomes 2.So the code correctly returns 2.But if the code didn't check inside the 'if' clause, but instead checked in each iteration, then the code could be written as:for each i:   if nums[i] > nums[i-1], current +=1   else: current =1   max_length = max(max_length, current)This way, in every iteration, regardless of whether current increased or reset, we check if it's the max.This would be better. Because, for example, in the case where the array ends with a reset. Like [3,4,5,2]. The max is 3 (3,4,5). The code after the loop would have the max correctly as 3. But in the code as initially written, the check for max_length only happens when the current_length is increased. Wait, no. Let me think.Original code:if nums[i] > prev:   current +=1   if current > max: updateelse:   current =1So, in the loop:When the next element is larger, current increases and then check for max.When it's not, current is reset to 1, but there's no check for the max.Wait, but in the case where current was 3 (max 3), then in the next step, if the element is smaller, current is set to 1, which is less than max. So the max remains 3. So the code would return 3, which is correct.But the problem is, during the iteration, when you have a current_length that is higher than the max, but only update the max when you are in an increasing step. However, the code as written could miss the maximum in some cases. Let me think of a case where that would happen.Suppose the array is [5,4,3,2,3]. The longest is 2 (2,3). Let's see:Initialize current and max to 1.i=1: 4 <5 → current 1. No update to max. Max remains 1.i=2:3<4 → current 1. Max 1.i=3:2 <3 → current 1. Max 1.i=4:3>2 → current becomes 2. Now check if 2>max (1), so max becomes 2.So the code returns 2, which is correct.Another example: [1,2,3,2,1]. The longest is 3. The code should return 3. Let's see:i=0: 2>1 → current 2 → max 2.i=1:3>2 → current 3 → max 3.i=2:2<3 → current 1. No change to max.i=3:1<2 → current 1.Final max is 3. Correct.But what if the array is [2,1,3]. The longest is 2 (1,3). Let's see:i=0: 1<2 → current 1. Max remains 1.i=1:3>1 → current 2. Check if 2>1 → yes. Max becomes 2.So code returns 2. Correct.But what if the array is [3,2,1,4,5,6]. The longest is 3 (4,5,6). Let's see:current starts at 1, max 1.i=0: 2<3 → current 1. Max 1.i=1:1<2 → current 1. Max 1.i=2:4>1 → current 2. Check → max becomes 2.i=3:5>4 → current 3. Check → max 3.i=4:6>5 → current 4. Check → max 4.So code returns 4. Which is correct.So the code works. But in the original code, the check is only done when the current_length is increased. So, the code is correct. Because when current_length is increased, that's when a new possible maximum is found. When it's reset, the current_length is 1, which is not larger than the previous max (unless the previous max was 0, which is not possible here). Wait, but what if the entire array is strictly increasing. For example, [1,2,3,4,5]. Then, each step increases current_length, and each step checks if it's larger than max. So, after first step: current 2, max 2. Second step: current 3, max 3. And so on. Correct.So the code is correct. But why not update max_length in every iteration regardless of whether we are in increasing or resetting? Because in the case where current_length is reset to 1, comparing to max is redundant. But in code, perhaps it's better to compute max_length in every step. Because then you don't have to have the check inside the 'if' block. So, the code could be rewritten as:for i in range(1, len(nums)):    if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:        current_length +=1    else:        current_length =1    if current_length > max_length:        max_length = current_lengthThat way, in every iteration, regardless of whether the current_length was increased or reset, we check if it's larger than the current max. This approach may be better because it's simpler and less error-prone.Yes, this approach is better. Because in the first code, suppose during the increasing step, we increment current_length but forget to check the max. But in the second approach, we check every time.Wait, for example, in code:Original code:if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:    current_length +=1    if current_length > max_length:        max_length = current_lengthelse:    current_length =1But if after the else, the current_length is set to 1, but if max_length was 0 (but that's not possible here). Wait, no. The initial max_length is 1. So, even in the else case, current_length is 1, which is not bigger than max_length (since max is at least 1). So in the else case, the code doesn't check. But that's safe. But in the alternative approach, the code checks regardless.Wait, but let's think of a case where current_length was larger than max_length, but then you have a reset. But that can't happen. Because when you reset current_length to 1, the max_length was already updated to the maximum possible in the previous steps.Wait, maybe not. For example, suppose you have a sequence where the current_length is 5, max_length is 5. Then, in the next step, the current element is smaller. So current_length becomes 1. The max remains 5. Which is correct. So checking after the else is not needed.But in the code where after each step (whether increasing or resetting), we check and update max_length, it's safer and perhaps more straightforward. Because then you don't have to think about whether the code is missing an update.So which approach is better?In the first approach (original code), when you are in an increasing step, you check and update max. But when you reset, you don't. So, in a scenario where the array is something like [5,6,7,8,1], the max would be 4 (5-8). Then, the reset to 1 doesn't affect the max. Which is correct.In the alternative approach, after each iteration, regardless of whether it's increasing or resetting, check and update. So in the example above, when you reset, the current_length is 1, which is less than the current max of 4, so no change. So same result.But in the alternative approach, for example, in a case where the array is [3,2,1,4], the code would do:i=0 (element 2): 2 <3 → current_length 1. Then check if 1>max (1) → no. Max remains 1.i=1 (element1): 1<2 → current_length 1. Check → no.i=2 (element4):4>1 → current_length becomes 2. Check → yes. Max becomes 2.So code returns 2. Which is correct.But in the original code, during the step where current_length increases to 2, the code would check and update max. So the same result.So, both approaches work.But which one is more efficient?The first approach updates the max only when current_length increases. The second approach updates the max in every iteration. For very large arrays, this could add a check in every iteration. But in practice, the difference is negligible. But for code clarity, the second approach might be better.So, modifying the code to the alternative approach.So code:class Solution:    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        if not nums:            return 0        max_length = 1        current_length = 1        for i in range(1, len(nums)):            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:                current_length +=1            else:                current_length = 1            if current_length > max_length:                max_length = current_length        return max_lengthYes, this code is more concise and ensures that after each step, the max is checked. So even if the current_length is increased but not checked, which could happen if the code was in the first approach but the 'if current_length > max' was omitted inside the 'if' block.So this code is better.Testing this code against the previous examples.Example 1:Loop steps:i=1 (3>1 → current=2. max becomes 2.i=2 (5>3 → current=3. max becomes 3.i=3 (4 <5 → current=1. max remains 3.i=4 (7>4 → current=2. max remains 3.Final return 3.Example 2:Loop steps:each i, current resets to 1, but max remains 1.So returns 1.Another example: [1,2,3,4]. The code will have current increasing each step, and max updated each time. So returns 4.Another example: [1]. Returns 1.Empty array returns 0.Yes, this code works.Thus, the correct approach is to track current_length, update it each step, and check for max_length each step.So the final code is as written above.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray) in an unsorted array of integers.

For each element:   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, increment \`current_length\`.   - If it is not, reset \`current_length\` to 1 since the increasing subsequence has been broken.   - After each update to \`current_length\`, check if it exceeds \`max_length\` and update \`max_length\` accordingly.4. Return Result: After iterating through the array, return \`max_length\` which holds the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence. Solution Code\`\`\`pythonfrom typing import Listclass Solution:    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        if not nums:            return 0        max_length = 1        current_length = 1        for i in range(1, len(nums)):            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:                current_length += 1            else:                current_length = 1            if current_length > max_length:                max_length = current_length        return max_length\`\`\` Explanation- Initialization: We handle the edge case of an empty array upfront. For non-empty arrays, we start with both \`current_length\` and \`max_length\` set to 1, as the minimum length of any valid subsequence is 1.- Iteration: By iterating through the array starting from the second element, we compare each element with its predecessor. If the current element continues the increasing trend, we extend the current subsequence. If not, we start a new subsequence from the current element.- Updating Maximum Length: After each adjustment to \`current_length\`, we check if it has surpassed the previously recorded maximum length. This ensures we always have the correct maximum value.This approach efficiently processes each element of the array exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This linear time complexity makes the solution optimal for large input sizes up to 10,000 elements as specified."},{"problem":"The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.Note:0 ≤ x, y < 231.Example:Input: x = 1, y = 4Output: 2Explanation:1   (0 0 0 1)4   (0 1 0 0)       ↑   ↑The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, I need to find the Hamming distance between two integers x and y. Hmm, the Hamming distance is the number of positions where the bits are different. So first, I should think about how to compare each bit of x and y.Wait, right. The standard approach for this problem is to compute the XOR of x and y. Because XOR gives a 1 in each bit position where the bits of x and y are different. Then, the Hamming distance is just the count of the number of 1s in the XOR result.So the steps would be:1. Compute x XOR y. Let's call this xor_result.2. Count the number of set bits (1s) in xor_result.Now, how do I count the number of set bits? There are a few ways to do that.One method is to iterate through each bit and check if it's set. For example, for each bit from 0 to 30 (since the input is less than 2^31), shift xor_result right by that many positions and check the least significant bit. Sum all the 1s.Alternatively, there's a clever way using the fact that n & (n-1) clears the least significant set bit. So you can keep doing this until n becomes zero, counting the steps.Let's think about the second method. For example, if xor_result is 5 (101), then:5 & 4 (101 & 100) = 4, count becomes 1.4 & 3 (100 & 011) = 0, count becomes 2. So total 2 set bits.That's efficient because the number of iterations is equal to the number of set bits. For numbers with many zeros, this is better.So, the plan is:Compute xor = x ^ yInitialize count to 0While xor is not zero:    xor = xor & (xor -1)    count +=1Return countYes, that should work.Wait, let's test the example given. x=1 (0001), y=4 (0100). XOR is 0101 (5). The number of 1s is 2, which matches the example.So the function would take x and y, compute their XOR, then count the 1s using this method.Now, coding this in Python.The function is part of a class Solution, method hammingDistance. So, inside the method:xor = x ^ ycount =0while xor:    xor &= xor -1    count +=1return countYes. That's straightforward.Testing another case. For x=0 and y=0, XOR is 0, count is 0. Correct.Another test: x=3 (11), y=1 (01). XOR is 10, which has 1 set bit. So Hamming distance 1. The code would return that.So this approach should work. I think that's the optimal solution here. No edge cases are missed because XOR handles all bit positions, and the loop correctly counts the number of 1s.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Hamming distance between two integers, which is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits of the two integers are different. ApproachThe Hamming distance can be efficiently determined using bitwise operations. The key steps are as follows:1. Compute XOR of the two integers: The XOR operation between two integers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. This means the result of XOR will have 1s exactly at the positions where the bits of the two numbers differ.2. Count the number of 1s in the XOR result: The number of 1s in the XOR result directly gives the Hamming distance. To count these 1s efficiently, we use a technique where we repeatedly clear the least significant set bit until the result becomes zero. Each iteration of this process reduces the number of 1s by one, allowing us to count them in a number of steps equal to the number of set bits.

XOR Operation: The XOR operation (\`x ^ y\`) between the two integers produces a number where each bit is 1 if the corresponding bits of \`x\` and \`y\` are different. For example, if \`x\` is 1 (\`0001\` in binary) and \`y\` is 4 (\`0100\` in binary), their XOR is 5 (\`0101\` in binary), which has two 1s.2. Counting Set Bits: The loop \`while xor: xor &= xor - 1; count += 1\` works by repeatedly clearing the least significant set bit in \`xor\`. Each iteration reduces \`xor\` by removing the rightmost 1, and the loop continues until all 1s are cleared. The count of iterations gives the number of 1s, which is the Hamming distance.This approach efficiently computes the Hamming distance with a time complexity of O(1) since the loop runs once for each bit set to 1 in the XOR result, and there are at most 32 bits for integers within the given constraint (0 ≤ x, y < 2^31)."},{"problem":"Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.Example 1:Input: 3Output: 0Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.Example 2:Input: 5Output: 1Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.","deepseek_reasoning":"Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of trailing zeros in n factorial. Hmm. Trailing zeros are created by factors of 10, right? And 10 is 2 multiplied by 5. So the number of trailing zeros depends on the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of n!.Wait, but in factorial, there are usually more 2s than 5s. For example, every even number contributes a 2, but only multiples of 5 contribute a 5. So the number of trailing zeros should be determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors.So the approach is to count how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. But wait, numbers like 25 contribute two 5s, right? Because 25 is 5^2. Similarly, 125 is 5^3, contributing three 5s. So we need to account for all those multiples.So the way to do this is to divide n by 5 to get the count of numbers divisible by 5, then divide by 25 for those divisible by 25 (each contributing an extra 5), then by 125, and so on until the division result is zero.Let's take an example. Let's say n is 100. 100 divided by 5 is 20, divided by 25 is 4, divided by 125 is 0. So total is 20 +4 =24. Which makes sense because 100! has 24 trailing zeros.Another example: n=5. 5/5=1, 5/25=0. So sum is 1. Correct.So the algorithm is to initialize a count to 0, then while n is greater than zero, divide n by 5, add the quotient to count, then set n to that quotient. Repeat until n becomes zero.Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. Let's take n=25. First iteration: 25//5=5, add to count (count=5). Then divide 5 by 5 again (since 25//5 is 5, but 25//25 is 1, which is the next term). Wait, maybe the loop is structured as:count =0while n>0:    n = n//5    count +=nSo for n=25:First iteration: 25//5=5, count=5. Then n=5. Next iteration: 5//5=1, count=6. n=1. Next iteration: 1//5=0, count remains 6. Then loop ends. So total is 5+1=6. Which is correct because 25! has 6 trailing zeros. Let's see: 25/5=5 numbers (5,10,15,20,25) each contribute one 5. But 25 contributes an extra, so total 5+1=6.Yes, that works. So the code is straightforward. So the function will loop, dividing n by 5 each time and adding the quotient to the count until the quotient is zero.So the Python code would be:def trailingZeroes(n):    count =0    while n>0:        n = n//5        count +=n    return countWait, but in the problem statement, the function is part of a class Solution.

Let's test the examples.Example 1: n=3. 3//5 is 0. So count remains 0. Correct.Example 2: n=5. 5//5=1, count=1. Then 1//5=0, loop ends. So returns 1. Correct.Another test case: n=25. Returns 5+1=6.

Hmm, right, bit manipulation might be the way to go here. Let me think about how addition works at the binary level.So when adding two binary numbers, the sum of two bits is XOR, and the carry is AND, shifted left by one. Like, for example, adding 3 (011) and 5 (101). XOR gives 110 (6), but the carry is 001 AND 101 which is 001, shifted left to 010. Then add the carry to the sum. Wait, but that's the same as the original problem again. So maybe we need to loop until there's no carry left.Wait, but how do we handle negative numbers? Because in Python, integers can be negative and they are represented in two's complement, but the problem is that Python has arbitrary-precision integers, so the usual bitwise operations might not work the same way as in, say, Java or C++ where integers are fixed-size. Oh right, that's a problem. Because in languages with fixed-size integers, after shifting, the carry would eventually become zero, but in Python, since numbers can be of arbitrary length, the loop might not terminate if there's a negative carry.Wait, let's test this. Let's take a simple case where a and b are positive. Let's say 1 + 2. The XOR of 1 (01) and 2 (10) is 11 (3), and the carry is 00. So sum is 3. That works. So for positive numbers, the process is straightforward.But what about when there's a carry that needs to be added again. For example, 3 (011) + 1 (001). XOR is 010 (2), carry is 001 (1) shifted left becomes 010 (2). Then sum those two: 2 and 2. XOR is 0, carry is 100 (4). Then next step, XOR 0 and 4 gives 4, carry is 0. So sum is 4. Wait, but 3+1 is 4. Correct.Another example: 5 + 7. Let's see. 5 is 101, 7 is 111. XOR is 010 (2), carry is (101 & 111) = 101, shifted left becomes 1010 (10). Then sum 2 and 10. XOR is 1000 (8), carry is (0010 & 1010) shifted left? Wait, wait. Let me redo the steps.First iteration:sum = a ^ b = 5 ^7 = 2 (010)carry = (5 &7) <<1 = (5) <<1 = 10 (1010)Then set a = sum (2), b= carry (10).Next iteration:sum = 2 ^10 = 8 (1000)carry = (2 &10) <<1. 2 is 0010, 10 is 1010. AND is 0010 &1010 = 0010. Shift left gives 100 (4). Now a is 8, b is 4.Next iteration:sum = 8^4 = 12 (1100)carry = (8 &4) <<1. 8 is 1000, 4 is 0100. AND is 0000. Shifted left is 0. Now, since carry is 0, sum is 12, which is correct (5+7=12). So the loop would terminate here.So the algorithm seems to work for positive numbers. But how about when one or both numbers are negative? Let's see.Take a case like -1 + 1. Let's see. In two's complement, -1 is all 1s. But Python uses arbitrary-length integers, so -1 is represented as ...11111111. But when you do bitwise operations in Python, it treats them as signed, but the actual bits are infinite leading 1s for negatives. So the standard approach may not work here because the carry might never become zero.Wait, let's try adding -1 and 1. According to the algorithm, the sum should be 0.First iteration:sum = -1 ^ 1. Let's see. In binary, -1 is ...11111111. 1 is ...00000001. XOR of those would be ...11111110, which is -2 in two's complement. But wait, no, in Python, the XOR of -1 and 1 is -2? Let's check in Python. Yes: in Python, (-1) ^ 1 is -2. Then the carry is (-1 & 1) <<1. The AND is 1, shifted left is 2. So now a is -2, b is 2.Next iteration: sum is -2 ^ 2. Let's compute that. -2 in binary is ...11111110. 2 is ...00000010. XOR is ...11111100, which is -4. Carry is (-2 & 2) <<1. The AND of ...11111110 and 00000010 is 2 (since only the second bit is set in 2, but in -2 that bit is 0). Wait, no. Let's compute -2 & 2: in Python, -2 is ...11111110, 2 is ...00000010. The AND is 00000010 (since the last bit is 0 in -2, but the second bit is 1 in 2 and 0 in -2? Wait no. Wait, 2 is 10 in binary, -2 is ...1111111111111110. The AND of 10 (2) and ...11111110 (-2) is 10 & 11111110 (assuming 8 bits) which would be 10. So, in Python, (-2) & 2 is 2. Then shifted left by 1 is 4. So a is -4, b is 4.Next iteration: sum is -4 ^4. Let's compute that. -4 in binary is ...11111100. 4 is ...00000100. XOR gives ...11111000, which is -8. Carry is (-4 &4) <<1. The AND of -4 and 4 is 4, shifted left is 8. So a is -8, b is 8.This loop will continue indefinitely, each time a becomes -2^k, b becomes 2^k, and sum becomes -2^(k+1), carry becomes 2^(k+1). So the loop would never terminate. Because the carry is always a positive number, and a is a negative number, and their XOR and carry would just keep getting larger in magnitude, but the carry never becomes zero.So the problem is that in Python, because integers are arbitrary-precision, this method would not work for cases where one number is negative and the other is positive, leading to an infinite loop.Therefore, the standard approach used in Java or C++ (which use 32-bit integers) will not work here, because Python doesn't have fixed-size integers. So how do we handle this?Wait, but maybe there's a way to mask the bits to a fixed size, say 32 bits, and handle the overflow. Because in those languages, when you add two numbers and there's a carry beyond 32 bits, it gets truncated, but in Python, that's not the case.So the solution would be to simulate 32-bit integers in Python. Let's think about that.So, the steps would be:1. Compute the sum and carry as before, but mask the numbers to 32 bits to prevent Python's infinite bits from causing issues.2. Handle the case where the sum is a negative number in 32 bits (i.e., when the 32nd bit is 1, which would indicate a negative number in two's complement).But how to do this?Alternatively, in each iteration, after calculating the sum and carry, we can mask them to 32 bits. For example, after each step, we can set a to (sum) & 0xFFFFFFFF, and the same for carry. But then we need to handle the case where the result is a 32-bit two's complement number, which could be converted to a Python int properly.Wait, but let's think through this.Let's say we are working in 32 bits. So any integer is represented as 32 bits. Then, after each step, we mask the sum and carry to 32 bits. Then, the carry would eventually become zero, even when adding positive and negative numbers.But how does that work?Let me try the example of -1 and 1 again, using 32 bits.In 32-bit two's complement, -1 is 0xFFFFFFFF (32 1's). So:sum = (-1) ^ 1 = 0xFFFFFFFF ^ 0x00000001 = 0xFFFFFFFE, which is -2 in two's complement. But in 32 bits, that's -2. The carry is (-1 & 1) <<1 = 0x1 <<1 = 0x2. Then a becomes 0xFFFFFFFE (sum), b becomes 0x00000002 (carry).Next iteration:sum = 0xFFFFFFFE ^ 0x00000002 = 0xFFFFFFFC (-4 in 32-bit). carry = (0xFFFFFFFE & 0x00000002) <<1 = (0x2) <<1 = 0x4. Then a = 0xFFFFFFFC, b=0x4.sum is 0xFFFFFFFC ^ 0x4 = 0xFFFFFFF8 (-8), carry is (0xFFFFFFFC & 0x4) <<1 = 0x4 <<1 = 0x8. And so on. This continues until the carry is 0x80000000, then sum becomes 0x00000000 (since sum is 0x80000000 ^ 0x80000000?), but wait, no.Wait, after some steps:Eventually, after 32 iterations, the carry would shift beyond the 32nd bit. Wait, perhaps this approach would work if we mask the sum and carry to 32 bits each time.Wait, but in Python, even after masking, the numbers are treated as positive if their highest bit is set, unless we convert them to two's complement.So here's the plan:- Use a loop to calculate sum and carry as before.- In each iteration, sum is (a ^ b) & 0xFFFFFFFF (masking to 32 bits).- carry is ((a & b) <<1) & 0xFFFFFFFF.- Then, set a = sum, b = carry.- Repeat until carry is 0.But then, after the loop, we need to convert the result (sum) from a 32-bit two's complement to a Python integer.So if the sum is greater than 0x7FFFFFFF (the maximum positive 32-bit integer), it's a negative number. So to convert it, we can subtract 0x100000000.For example, if the sum is 0xFFFFFFFF (32 bits), which is -1 in two's complement. So in Python, after masking, the sum is 0xFFFFFFFF, which is 4294967295. We subtract 0x100000000 (4294967296) to get -1.So the code would look like:def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:    mask = 0xFFFFFFFF    while b != 0:        a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask    return a if a <= 0x7FFFFFFF else ~(a ^ mask)Wait, wait. Let's think about that. Alternatively, to handle the sign:After the loop, if a is more than 0x7FFFFFFF (the maximum positive 32-bit signed integer), then it is a negative number. So to convert it to Python's two's complement, we can invert the bits and add 1, but perhaps a better way is to compute it as a signed 32-bit integer.Wait, but how to convert a 32-bit unsigned integer to a signed integer in Python.For example, if the result is 0x80000000 (which is 2147483648 in decimal), that's the minimum 32-bit two's complement integer, -2147483648.So the formula is: if the value is >= 0x80000000, subtract 0x100000000.So:if a >= 0x80000000:    a -= 0x100000000But since in Python, integers can be negative, but when we mask with 0xFFFFFFFF, it's treated as a positive number. So after masking, when the highest bit is set (i.e., when the original 32 bits represent a negative number in two's complement), the value is in the range 0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF, which is 2147483648 to 4294967295. So subtracting 0x100000000 (4294967296) from those numbers would give the correct negative value.For example:0xFFFFFFFF (4294967295) - 0x100000000 = -1.0x80000000 (2147483648) - 0x100000000 = -2147483648.So in code:if a > 0x7FFFFFFF:    a -= 0x100000000But how to implement that.Alternatively, you can use bitwise operations. For example:a = a if a <= 0x7FFFFFFF else (a | (~0xFFFFFFFF))Wait, not sure. Let's see: if a is 0xFFFFFFFF (which is 4294967295), then in 32-bit two's complement, this is -1. So in Python, to represent this, we need to set all the higher bits beyond 32 to 1. How can we do that?Another approach is to sign extend the 32-bit number. So for the 32-bit value stored in a variable, if the sign bit (bit 31) is set, then all higher bits are set to 1.So, in Python, after masking, we can check if the 32nd bit is set. If so, invert the mask's bits and negate.Wait, for example:We can compute the maximum 32-bit positive number: 0x7FFFFFFF.If the result a is greater than this, then it's a negative number. So, to get the correct value, we can invert the bits (but only in the 32-bit context) and add 1, then negate. Alternatively, subtract 0x100000000.So, for example:If a is 0xFFFFFFFF (4294967295), subtract 0x100000000 (4294967296) gives -1.So the code would be:if a > 0x7FFFFFFF:    a -= 0x100000000But in Python, integers can be of arbitrary length, so this would correctly handle the 32-bit overflow.So putting it all together:class Solution:    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:        mask = 0xFFFFFFFF        max_int = 0x7FFFFFFF                while b != 0:            a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask                # Handle overflow        if a > max_int:            a = ~(a ^ mask)        return aWait, let me test this with some examples.Test case 1: a=1, b=2.Loop steps:Initially, a=1, b=2.First iteration:sum = 1^2=3 (0b11), carry is (1&2)<<1=0<<1=0. So after first iteration, b becomes 0. So loop exits. a is 3, which is 3. Then since a (3) <= max_int (2147483647), returns 3. Correct.Test case 2: a=-1, b=1.Loop steps:mask is 0xFFFFFFFF.Initially, a=-1, b=1.But after masking, during each step:First iteration:sum = (-1) ^1. But what is (-1) ^1 in Python?In Python, -1 is ...11111111 (in two's complement). 1 is ...00000001. XOR gives ...11111110, which is -2. But mask is 0xFFFFFFFF. So (-2) & 0xFFFFFFFF is 0xFFFFFFFE, which is 4294967294. So sum is 0xFFFFFFFE. carry is ( (-1 & 1) <<1 ) & mask. (-1 &1) is 1. <<1 is 2. &mask is 2. So b becomes 2.Second iteration:a is 0xFFFFFFFE (4294967294), b is 2.sum = 4294967294 ^2 = 4294967292. carry is (4294967294 &2) <<1. 4294967294 in binary is 0xFF...FE, so the second bit (from right) is 0. 2 is 0x10. So AND is 2, <<1 is 4. &mask is 4. So b becomes 4.Third iteration:sum is 4294967292 ^4 = 4294967288. carry is (4294967292 &4) <<1. 4294967292 in binary is ...1111100. 4 is 100. The AND is 4, shifted left is 8. So b=8.This loop continues until the carry becomes 0x80000000 (2147483648) and sum becomes 0x00000000. Let's see:Wait, after 32 iterations:At step i, the carry is 2^i, and sum is 0xFFFFFFFF - 2^i +1 ?Wait, perhaps this isn't the right way. Let me see:Each iteration, the carry is shifting left by 1. So after 32 iterations, the carry would have been shifted left 32 times. But since we mask each carry with 0xFFFFFFFF, when the carry is shifted beyond 32 bits, the mask will cap it. Wait, but ((a & b) <<1) & mask: when shifting left, if the original value has a bit set at position 30, then shifting left by 1 makes it position 31, but <<1 then &mask will keep it as 31 bits. But if shifting left by 1 causes a carry beyond 32 bits, then the mask will truncate it.Wait, but in the case of a= -1 and b=1:The loop would proceed until the carry is 0x80000000 (32nd bit set). Then sum would be (0xFFFFFFFF ^ 0x80000000) & mask.0xFFFFFFFF is 4294967295, which in binary is 32 1's. 0x80000000 is 2147483648 (binary 1 followed by 31 zeros). XOR gives 0x7FFFFFFF (31 ones), which is 2147483647. carry is (0xFFFFFFFF & 0x80000000) <<1. The AND of 0xFFFFFFFF and 0x80000000 is 0x80000000. Shifted left by 1 is 0x100000000. But masked with 0xFFFFFFFF gives 0x0. So now, a becomes 0x7FFFFFFF (2147483647), and b becomes 0. So the loop terminates. Then, since a (2147483647) <= max_int (2147483647), returns 2147483647. But wait, that's not correct. Because -1 +1 should be 0.Hmm, what's wrong here.Wait, let's re-examine the code.In the code, during each iteration:sum = (a ^ b) & maskcarry = ((a & b) << 1) & maskSo after the initial steps for a=-1 and b=1:sum is (0xFFFFFFFF ^ 0x00000001) & mask = (0xFFFFFFFE) & mask = 0xFFFFFFFE (4294967294)carry is (0xFFFFFFFF & 0x00000001) <<1 = 1 <<1 =2, masked to 0x2.Then a becomes 0xFFFFFFFE (4294967294), b becomes 2.Next iteration:sum is 0xFFFFFFFE ^ 0x2 = 0xFFFFFFFC (4294967292), carry is (0xFFFFFFFE &0x2) <<1 = 0x2 <<1 =4.Then a=4294967292, b=4.sum is 0xFFFFFFFC ^0x4 = 0xFFFFFFF8 (4294967288), carry is (0xFFFFFFFC &0x4) <<1 = 0x4 <<1=8.Continuing this way:After 31 iterations:sum becomes 0x80000000 (2147483648), carry is (0x80000000 & 0x80000000) <<1 & mask.The & of 0x80000000 and 0x80000000 is 0x80000000. Shift left by 1 gives 0x100000000. Masked with 0xFFFFFFFF gives 0.So a becomes 0x80000000 (2147483648), b becomes 0.Loop terminates. Now, since a is 2147483648, which is greater than max_int (2147483647), we compute a = ~(a ^ mask).Let's compute that. a ^ mask is 0x80000000 ^ 0xFFFFFFFF. Let's compute in binary:0x80000000 is 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 (binary 32 bits)0xFFFFFFFF is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111.XOR gives 01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111, which is 0x7FFFFFFF.Then ~ of that is 0x80000000 (since in Python, ~x = -x-1. So 0x7FFFFFFF is 2147483647. ~0x7FFFFFFF is -2147483648, which is 0x80000000 in two's complement. So a becomes -2147483648. But the correct answer is 0. So something's wrong.Ah, this shows that the code isn't handling the case where a and b sum to zero correctly.Wait, but how can this be? Let's retrace the steps for a=-1 and b=1.But according to the code, after the loop, a would be 0x80000000 (2147483648) and b=0. Then since a > max_int (2147483647), we do a = ~(a ^ mask).So a ^ mask is 2147483648 ^ 0xFFFFFFFF. Let's compute that in 32-bit terms.But since a is 0x80000000 (binary 1000...0000), mask is 0xFFFFFFFF (binary 1111...1111), XOR is 0111...1111, which is 0x7FFFFFFF (2147483647). Then ~ of that is -2147483648 (since ~x is -x-1, so ~2147483647 is -2147483648). So the code returns -2147483648, which is incorrect. But -1 +1 is 0. So this approach isn't working.Hmm, so the code as written doesn't handle this case correctly. So what's wrong here.Ah, I see. The problem is that the loop is terminating when b is zero. But in the case of a=-1 and b=1, after 32 iterations, the carry becomes zero, but the sum is not correct. So why is the loop terminating after 32 iterations?Wait, let's think about the loop steps again for a=-1 and b=1.Let me try to simulate the code step by step for this case.Original a: -1 (0xFFFFFFFF in 32 bits)Original b: 1 (0x00000001)Loop starts:First iteration:sum = (a ^ b) & mask → (0xFFFFFFFF ^ 0x00000001) → 0xFFFFFFFE → mask gives 0xFFFFFFFE (4294967294)carry = ((a & b) <<1) & mask → (0x00000001 <<1) → 0x00000002 → mask gives 2.Now a=0xFFFFFFFE, b=2.Second iteration:sum = 0xFFFFFFFE ^ 2 → 0xFFFFFFFC (4294967292)carry = (0xFFFFFFFE & 2) <<1 → 2 <<1 =4.a=0xFFFFFFFC, b=4.Third iteration:sum = 0xFFFFFFFC ^4 → 0xFFFFFFF8 (4294967288)carry = (0xFFFFFFFC &4) <<1 → 4 <<1 =8....Continuing this until the 32nd iteration:After each iteration, the sum is decremented by 4, 8, etc. Each time, the sum is 0xFFFFFFFF - (current sum step), and the carry is doubling each time.After 31 iterations, carry would be 0x40000000 (1073741824). Next iteration:sum = (a ^ b) = 0xC0000000 (3221225472) ^ 0x40000000 → 0x80000000 (2147483648)carry = (0xC0000000 & 0x40000000) <<1 → 0x40000000 <<1 → 0x80000000, which after masking becomes 0x80000000 (2147483648).So now, a=0x80000000, b=0x80000000.Next iteration:sum = 0x80000000 ^0x80000000 → 0x0.carry = (0x80000000 & 0x80000000) <<1 → 0x80000000 <<1 =0x100000000. Masked with 0xFFFFFFFF → 0x0.So now, a=0x0, b=0.Loop terminates.Then, since a is 0, which is <= max_int (2147483647), returns 0. Which is correct.So why did my previous calculation give a different result? Because I must have missed the step where the carry finally becomes zero after 32 iterations.Ah, right. So after 32 iterations, the carry becomes zero. So in this case, the code works.But wait, let's see:Wait, when a=0x80000000 and b=0x80000000, sum is 0, carry is (0x80000000 &0x80000000) <<1 → 0x80000000 <<1 =0x100000000 → masked to 0.So in the next iteration, b becomes 0, so loop terminates, and a is 0. So code returns 0, which is correct.But how many iterations does this take? For a=-1 and b=1, it takes 32 iterations. Because each iteration shifts the carry left by 1. The initial carry is 2 (from the first iteration), then 4, 8, ... up to 2^31. Then when carry is 2^31 (0x80000000), the next sum is (0x80000000 ^0x80000000) =0, and carry is (0x80000000 &0x80000000) <<1 →0x100000000 which masked is 0. So after 32 iterations, the loop terminates.So in code, the loop will terminate even for negative numbers. Because after a finite number of steps (32), the carry becomes zero.So why did the previous example with a=0x80000000 and b=0x80000000 terminate with sum 0? Because after that step, the carry is zero.So the code should work.Wait, but why was the earlier simulation giving a different result? Because perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation steps.Let me re-simulate the case of a=-1 and b=1 using the code.Loop steps:Initially, a=-1 (which is 0xFFFFFFFF when masked), b=1.But wait, in code, the initial a and b are not masked. Wait, no. The code masks a and b in each iteration.Wait, in the code, during each iteration:sum is (a ^ b) & mask.carry is ((a & b) <<1) & mask.So the initial a and b are passed into the loop as is. Let's see.First iteration:a is -1 (but when XORed with 1, the result is -2, which when masked with 0xFFFFFFFF is 0xFFFFFFFE (4294967294).carry is (-1 & 1) <<1 → 1 <<1 → 2. Then masked to 2.So a becomes 4294967294, b becomes 2.Second iteration:sum is 4294967294 ^ 2 = 4294967292 (0xFFFFFFFC), masked.carry is (4294967294 & 2) <<1 → 2 <<1 →4.So b becomes 4.... and so on.Each iteration, the carry is shifted left, and after 32 iterations, the carry will have shifted 32 times, but with masking, it's always within 32 bits. So after 32 iterations, the carry becomes zero.So in the code, for a=-1 and b=1, after 32 iterations, the loop will exit with a=0, which is correct.So why was the previous code returning -2147483648? Because I had a mistake in the code. Let me check the code again.In the code:After the loop, if a is greater than max_int (0x7FFFFFFF), then we compute a = ~(a ^ mask).Let's see for a=0x80000000 (after the loop), which is 2147483648.a is greater than max_int (2147483647), so we compute a = ~(a ^ mask).a ^ mask is 0x80000000 ^ 0xFFFFFFFF. Let's compute this in binary:0x80000000 is 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000.0xFFFFFFFF is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111.XOR gives 01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 (0x7FFFFFFF).Then ~ of 0x7FFFFFFF is -2147483648 in 32-bit terms, which is correct. But in Python, this is indeed -2147483648. But wait, in the case of a=0, after the loop, the code returns a=0, which is correct.So in the case where the sum is 0, the code returns 0.But in the case where a=0x80000000, which is 2147483648, which is greater than max_int, the code computes ~(0x80000000 ^0xFFFFFFFF) = ~0x7FFFFFFF = -2147483648. But why is that the case?Ah, but in the case where the sum is zero, the loop exits with a=0, which is correct. So the code works.But how about for the case of a=0x80000000 (after the loop), which is the case when sum is 0x80000000? No, the loop exits when b is zero, which in that case, a would have the sum.Wait, but the code masks a in each iteration. So after the loop, a is the sum after applying the mask. So, for the case of adding -1 and 1, the loop should exit with a=0.So perhaps the code is correct.Let me recheck the code.The code is:def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:    mask = 0xFFFFFFFF    max_int = 0x7FFFFFFF    while b != 0:        a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask    if a > max_int:        a = ~(a ^ mask)    return aSo, when a and b are -1 and 1, after 32 iterations, the loop terminates with a=0 and b=0. Then, since a=0 is <= max_int, returns 0. Which is correct.Wait, this contradicts the previous example where I thought that a would become 0x80000000, but that's only if the iterations are not enough. Let me re-simulate with the code.Let me step through the code for a=-1 and b=1.Initial a = -1, b=1.First iteration:sum = (-1) ^1 = -2. mask is 0xFFFFFFFF. So sum is (-2) & 0xFFFFFFFF = 0xFFFFFFFE (4294967294).carry = (-1 & 1) <<1 → 1 <<1 →2 → masked to 2.a = 4294967294, b=2.Second iteration:sum = 4294967294 ^2 = 4294967292 (0xFFFFFFFC).carry = (4294967294 & 2) <<1 → 2 <<1 →4.a=4294967292, b=4.Third iteration:sum = 4294967292 ^4 = 4294967288 (0xFFFFFFF8).carry = (4294967292 &4) <<1 →4 <<1 →8.a=4294967288, b=8....This continues until the carry is 0x80000000 (2147483648).Iteration when b=2147483648 (0x80000000):sum = a ^b.a is 0x80000000 (but how did it get here?)Wait, after 31 iterations:b is 0x40000000 (1073741824).sum = a ^b → 0xC0000000 (3221225472) ^0x40000000 (1073741824) → 0x80000000 (2147483648).carry = (0xC0000000 &0x40000000) <<1 → 0x40000000 <<1 →0x80000000.So a=0x80000000 (2147483648), b=0x80000000.Next iteration:sum = 2147483648 ^ 2147483648 →0.carry = (2147483648 & 2147483648) <<1 → 2147483648 <<1 → 4294967296. But masked with 0xFFFFFFFF →0.So a=0, b=0.Loop terminates. So returns a=0, which is correct.So the code works for this case.Another test case: a= -2 and b=3.Expected sum is 1.Let's see:a=-2, b=3.First iteration:sum = (-2)^3 = -3 (0xFFFFFFFD), masked to 0xFFFFFFFD (4294967293).carry = (-2 &3) <<1 → (2) <<1 →4.a=4294967293, b=4.sum = 4294967293 ^4 → 4294967293 is 0xFFFFFFFD, 4 is 0x00000004. XOR is 0xFFFFFFF9 (4294967289).carry = (4294967293 &4) →4, shifted left to 8.a=4294967289, b=8.sum = 4294967289 ^8 → 0xFFFFFFF1 (4294967281).carry = (4294967289 &8) <<1 →8 <<1=16....This process continues until the carry becomes 0x80000000.After multiple iterations, the sum will eventually become 1 and the carry will be zero.Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to calculate:Wait, a=-2 is 0xFFFFFFFE in 32 bits. 3 is 0x00000003.sum = 0xFFFFFFFE ^0x3 →0xFFFFFFFD (4294967293). carry is (0xFFFFFFFE &0x3) <<1 → 0x2 <<1 →0x4.So a=4294967293, b=4.sum = 4294967293 ^4 →4294967293 in binary is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111101, XOR with 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000100 → 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111001 (4294967289).carry is (4294967293 &4) →4 → shifted to 8.a=4294967289, b=8.sum = 4294967289 ^8 → 4294967281.carry is (4294967289 &8) →8 → shifted to 16.This continues until the carry is 0x80000000.At some point, the sum will be 0xFFFFFFFF, and carry will be 0x0, but no. Maybe this approach isn't the right way to see it.Alternatively, perhaps this code works for all cases.Let me test another example where a=5 and b=7.As before, the sum is 12. The code should return 12.After the loop:a=5, b=7.sum =5^7=2, carry = (5&7) <<1 =5 <<1=10.a=2, b=10.sum=2^10=8, carry=(2&10)<<1= 2<<1=4.a=8, b=4.sum=8^4=12, carry=(8&4)<<1=0. So loop terminates. a=12 <=max_int, return 12. Correct.Another test case: a= -8, b= -4.Expected sum: -12.Let's see:a=-8, b=-4.In 32 bits, -8 is 0xFFFFFFF8, -4 is 0xFFFFFFFC.sum = (-8) ^ (-4) → 0xFFFFFFF8 ^0xFFFFFFFC → 0x00000004.carry = (-8 &-4) <<1 → (0xFFFFFFF8 &0xFFFFFFFC) →0xFFFFFFF8, shifted left by 1 →0xFFFFFFF0.But masked with 0xFFFFFFFF gives 0xFFFFFFF0 (4294967280).So a=4, b=4294967280.Now, loop continues:sum =4 ^ 4294967280 → 4 is 0x00000004, 4294967280 is 0xFFFFFFF0. XOR is 0xFFFFFFF4 (4294967284).carry = (4 & 4294967280) <<1 →0 <<1 →0.So a=4294967284, b=0. Loop terminates.Then, since a=4294967284 is greater than max_int (2147483647), compute a = ~(a ^ mask).a ^ mask is 4294967284 ^0xFFFFFFFF → 4294967284 is 0xFFFFFFF4, XOR with 0xFFFFFFFF gives 0x0000000B. Then ~0x0B is -0x0C (-12), which is the correct sum.So code returns -12. Correct.Thus, the code works.So the correct code is:class Solution:    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:        mask = 0xFFFFFFFF        max_int = 0x7FFFFFFF                while b != 0:            a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask                # Handle overflow        if a > max_int:            a = ~(a ^ mask)        return aThis code uses bitwise operations and handles negative numbers by simulating 32-bit two's complement arithmetic.

Hmm, how to approach this.Let me think about the examples. For example 1, [\\"flower\\",\\"flow\\",\\"flight\\"], the common prefix is \\"fl\\". For example 2, there's no common prefix, so return empty string.First, what if the list is empty? Oh, according to the note, probably the problem assumes there's at least one string, but maybe not. Wait, the examples have inputs with 3 strings. But what if the input list is empty? Well, the function should return empty string then. So I need to handle that case.So the steps could be:1. Check if the input list is empty. If yes, return \\"\\".2. Find the shortest string in the list because the maximum possible common prefix can't be longer than the shortest string.3. Compare each character of the shortest string across all other strings.4. Stop at the first character where there's a mismatch.5. Return the substring up to that point.Alternatively, another approach is to take the first string as reference, and compare each character position with all other strings. If any string is shorter than that position, or the character doesn't match, then return the substring up to the previous position.So let's outline the steps:- If the list is empty, return \\"\\".- Take the first string as the reference.- Iterate over each index in the first string's characters.- For each index i, check all other strings in the list.- If any string has a length <= i or its i-th character is different from the reference's, then return the substring up to i (exclusive).- If all checked, return the entire reference string.Wait, but what if the first string is the longest? Then comparing up to its length might be overstepping into other shorter strings. Oh right, because other strings might be shorter. So the loop should go up to the minimum length of all strings. Wait, but how to efficiently get that?Alternatively, during the iteration, for each character position i in the first string, check if all other strings have a character at i. If any string is shorter than i, then we can't have a longer prefix, so return up to i.So here's the plan:1. If the input list is empty, return \\"\\".2. If the list has one string, return that string.3. Take the first string as the reference.4. For each index i in the reference string:   a. Check all other strings in the list.   b. For each other string:      i. If the string's length is <= i, then the longest possible prefix is up to i, so return the substring up to i.      ii. If the character at i is not equal to the reference's i-th character, return the substring up to i.5. If all characters are matched up to the length of the reference, then return the reference string.But what if other strings are longer than the reference? For example, reference is \\"flow\\", others are \\"flower\\". Then, after checking all characters in \\"flow\\", if they all match, the longest prefix is \\"flow\\".Yes, that's correct.So let's code this logic.Edge cases:- Empty list: return \\"\\"- List with one string: return the string.- All strings are the same: return the entire string.- Some strings are longer than the first, but others are shorter.Let's code step by step.First, check if strs is empty. If so, return \\"\\".Then, loop through each character index in the first string. For each i:Loop through each string in strs starting from index 1.If any string in strs has length <=i, then return first_str[:i].Otherwise, check if the current string's i-th character is same as first string's. If not, return first_str[:i].If all are checked and passed for all i in first string, then return first_str.Wait, but the first string might be longer than the shortest string in the list. For example, if the first string is \\"abcd\\", but another string is \\"a\\". Then, for i=0, all are same. For i=1, the second string has length 1, so return first_str[:1] which is 'a'.Yes, so this approach works even if the first string is longer than others, because when i reaches the length of a shorter string, the code will return.So the code:def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:    if not strs:        return \\"\\"    first = strs[0]    for i in range(len(first)):        char = first[i]        for s in strs[1:]:            if i >= len(s) or s[i] != char:                return first[:i]    return firstWait, but what if the first string is the only string? Then the loop runs through all its characters, and returns first. Which is correct.Another example: input is [\\"a\\"]. The loop runs len(first) times, which is 1. So i ranges from 0 to 0. For each i, loop through strs[1:] which is empty. So the inner loop doesn't run. So after the for loop completes, return first. Which is correct.Another example: [\\"ab\\", \\"a\\"]. Then for i=0, check s is \\"a\\". char is 'a' in first. So s[i] is 'a' which matches. Then i=1. For s in strs[1:], s is \\"a\\". len(s) is 1, which is i=1. So 1 >= len(s) (1 >=1, yes). So return first[:1] which is 'a'.Yes.Another test case: [\\"flower\\",\\"flow\\",\\"flight\\"].i=0: check 'f' in all. All have 'f'.i=1: 'l' in all. check.i=2: 'o' in first string. Check other strings. flow's i=2 is 'o', flight's i=2 is 'i'. So flight's character is different. So return first[:2] which is 'fl'.Yes.This should work.So this code should handle all cases.Testing code:Test case 1: [\\"flower\\",\\"flow\\",\\"flight\\"] returns \\"fl\\".Test case 2: [\\"dog\\",\\"racecar\\",\\"car\\"] returns \\"\\".Because for i=0, check 'd' in other strings. The first other string is 'racecar' which has i=0 as 'r' which is not 'd', so return first[:0] which is empty.Another case: [\\"\\", \\"abc\\"] → returns \\"\\".Because first string is empty, the loop doesn't run. Returns first, which is empty.Another case: [\\"abc\\", \\"\\", \\"ab\\"] → returns \\"\\".Because first string is \\"abc\\", i=0. Check other strings. The second string is \\"\\", len is 0. So i=0 >= len(s) (0 >=0 is true). So return first[:0] → \\"\\".Yes.So the code should handle all these cases.","deepseek_solution":"To solve this problem, we need to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

I need to find the number of special positions in a matrix. So, a position (i,j) is special if mat[i][j] is 1, and all other elements in row i and column j are 0. Hmm, right. So for each cell that is 1, I have to check two things: the entire row except that cell, and the entire column except that cell. If both of those are all zeros, then it's a special position.Wait, but how do I do that efficiently? Let's think about the steps.First, I need to iterate through each cell in the matrix. For each cell where the value is 1, check its row and column. Let's break it down.For a cell (i,j) that is 1:1. Check the sum of the row i. If the sum is exactly 1, then there are no other 1s in the row. Because the current cell is 1 and the sum is 1, so all others must be zero. So that's the row condition.2. Similarly, check the sum of column j. If the sum is exactly 1, then the column is good.So if both the row sum and column sum are 1, then that cell is special.Wait, but how to compute the sum of the row and column? Let's think.For each row in the matrix, we can precompute the sum of that row. Similarly for each column. Then, for any cell (i,j) that is 1, if row_sums[i] == 1 and column_sums[j] == 1, then it's special.Yes, that's a good approach. Because then we don't have to check every element in the row and column each time. Precomputing the sums once for all rows and columns would save time, especially if the matrix is large.So the steps would be:1. Precompute the sum for each row. Store in a list row_sums where row_sums[i] is the sum of mat[i].2. Precompute the sum for each column. Store in a list col_sums where col_sums[j] is the sum of column j.3. Iterate over each cell (i,j) in the matrix. For each cell where mat[i][j] == 1, check if row_sums[i] == 1 and col_sums[j] == 1. If yes, increment the count.Yes, that makes sense.Now, how to compute the column sums. Because in Python, each row is a list, so to get the sum of a column j, we need to sum all mat[i][j] for each i.So, for example, for a matrix of m rows and n columns:col_sums = [0] * nfor j in range(n):    sum_col = 0    for i in range(m):        sum_col += mat[i][j]    col_sums[j] = sum_colAlternatively, using list comprehensions. But for code clarity, perhaps using loops.Similarly, row_sums is easier since each row is a list. row_sums = [sum(row) for row in mat]So, the code structure would be:Compute row_sums and col_sums.Initialize count to 0.Loop through each i in 0 to rows-1:   loop through each j in 0 to cols-1:       if mat[i][j] == 1:           if row_sums[i] == 1 and col_sums[j] == 1:               count +=1Return count.Yes. That should work.Now, let's test this approach against the examples.Take Example 1:mat = [ [1,0,0], [0,0,1], [1,0,0]]Row sums: row 0 sum is 1, row1 sum is 1, row2 sum is 1. So row_sums = [1,1,1]Column sums:col0: 1 +0 +1 = 2.col1: 0 +0 +0 =0.col2:0 +1 +0=1.So for each cell that is 1:(0,0): row_sum 1, col_sum 2. Not good.(1,2): row_sum 1, col_sum 1. So this is a special position. So count is 1.(2,0): row_sum 1, col_sum 2. Not good. So total 1. Which matches the example.Example 2:mat = [[1,0,0],       [0,1,0],       [0,0,1]]Row sums are 1,1,1.Column sums: 1 (col0), 1 (col1), 1 (col2).Each diagonal element is 1. So for each (i,i), row and column sum are 1. So 3 special positions. Which matches.Example 3:mat = [ [0,0,0,1], [1,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,0]]Row sums:row0:1, row1:1, row2:2, row3:0.col0:1 (row1 has 1), col1:1 (row2 has 1), col2:1 (row2 has another 1?), wait:Wait, let's compute the columns.columns:col0: 0 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) +0 (row3) = 1.col1: 0 +0 +1 +0 =1.col2: 0 +0 +1 +0 =1.col3:1 (row0) +0 (row1) +0 (row2) +0 (row3) =1.So col_sums for each column is 1,1,1,1.Now check each 1 in the matrix.Row0 has 1 at (0,3). Row sum is 1. Column sum for column3 is 1. So this is a special position.Row1 has 1 at (1,0). Row sum 1. Column sum for column0 is 1. So another special position.Row2 has two 1s. For (2,1): row sum is 2, so no. For (2,2): row sum is 2, no.So total two special positions. Which matches example 3.So this approach works for all examples.Now, considering the constraints, with up to 100 rows and 100 columns, this approach is O(rows*cols) time and space (for the row and column sums). Which is acceptable.So the code can be written as:Compute row_sums as a list of sum of each row.Compute col_sums as a list of sum of each column.Then, iterate each cell, check if mat[i][j] is 1 and row_sums[i] and col_sums[j] are 1.Now, code-wise, in Python:First, row_sums = [sum(row) for row in mat]For columns, since each column is across rows, we need to loop through each row and sum the j-th element.cols = len(mat[0])col_sums = [0] * colsfor j in range(cols):    s = 0    for i in range(len(mat)):        s += mat[i][j]    col_sums[j] = sThen, count the number of positions where mat[i][j] ==1 and row_sums[i] ==1 and col_sums[j] ==1.So the code would be:def numSpecial(mat):    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in mat]    cols = len(mat[0]) if mat else 0    col_sums = [0] * cols    for j in range(cols):        s = 0        for i in range(len(mat)):            s += mat[i][j]        col_sums[j] = s    count =0    for i in range(len(mat)):        for j in range(cols):            if mat[i][j] == 1 and row_sums[i] ==1 and col_sums[j] ==1:                count +=1    return countWait, but what if the matrix is empty? Well, the constraints say 1 <= rows, cols <=100, so we don't need to handle empty matrices. So the code should be safe.Let's test example 4:mat = [ [0,0,0,0,0], [1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,1]]Row sums:row0: 0.row1:1.row2:1.row3:1.row4:2.col_sums:col0: 0+1+0+0+0 =1.col1:0+0+1+0+0=1.col2:0+0+0+1+0=1.col3:0+0+0+0+1=1.col4:0+0+0+0+1=1.So check each 1 in the matrix:Row1, j=0: row sum 1, col sum 1. So count +=1.Row2, j=1: row sum 1, col sum 1. count +=1.Row3, j=2: row sum 1, col sum 1. count +=1.Row4, j=3: row sum 2. So not counted.Row4, j=4: row sum 2.

Let's think about how to approach this.Hmm, the brute force way would be to check every possible pair, but with the time length up to 60,000, that would be O(n²) time, which is way too slow. So I need a more efficient approach.Wait, the key here is to find pairs (i, j) where (time[i] + time[j]) mod 60 is 0. So for each element, I can look for elements that when added together, their sum mod 60 is zero. But how can I track this efficiently?Maybe if I can keep track of the remainders when each time is divided by 60. Because if two numbers have remainders that add up to 60 (or zero in the case where both are zero), then their sum will be divisible by 60.So for each time value, compute remainder = time % 60. Then, for a current remainder r, the number of previous elements that have a remainder of (60 - r) % 60 would contribute to the count. Because adding r and (60 - r) gives 60, which mod 60 is 0. Also, if r is zero, then we need other elements with remainder zero, because 0 + 0 is 0 mod 60.So the idea is to use a dictionary or array to count the frequency of each remainder. Then, for each element's remainder, look up how many elements have the complementary remainder (which would make the sum divisible by 60), and add that to the count.Wait, but since we process elements one by one, and for each element, we check against the elements that came before it (since i < j), we can accumulate the count as we build the remainder counts.Let me think step by step:1. Initialize a list or a dictionary to keep track of the count of each remainder. Since the possible remainders when divided by 60 are 0 to 59, an array of size 60 is sufficient. Let's call it remainders_count, initialized with 0s.2. Initialize the result count to 0.3. For each time in the list:   a. Compute remainder = time % 60.   b. Compute the complement_remainder = (60 - remainder) % 60. Because if remainder is 0, complement is 0. For example, if remainder is 20, complement is 40. If remainder is 40, complement is 20. So this handles all possible pairs.   c. Add to the result the current count of complement_remainder in the remainders_count array.   d. Then, increment the count of the current remainder in the remainders_count array.Wait, but why step 3c? Because for the current element's remainder, the complement_remainder is what we need. The number of elements that have already been processed (i.e., those before the current element) with the complement_remainder is the number of pairs that can be formed with the current element as j and those elements as i (since i < j). So by adding that count to the result, we accumulate all valid pairs.Yes, that makes sense.Let me test this logic with Example 1:Example 1: Input [30,20,150,100,40]Let's process each element:Initialize remainders_count as [0] * 60, count =0.First element: 30. remainder is 30. complement is (60-30) mod 60 = 30. So look up remainders_count[30] which is 0. Add 0 to count. Then increment remainders_count[30] to 1.Second element: 20. remainder 20. complement is 40. remainders_count[40] is 0. So count remains 0. Then increment remainders_count[20] to 1.Third element:150. 150 mod 60 is 30. complement is 30. remainders_count[30] is 1. So add 1 to count (count becomes 1). Then increment remainders_count[30] to 2.Fourth element:100. 100 mod60 is 40. complement is 20. remainders_count[20] is 1. So add 1 to count (now 2). Then increment remainders_count[40] to 1.Fifth element:40. mod60 is 40. complement is 20. remainders_count[20] is 1. Add 1 to count (total 3). Then increment remainders_count[40] to 2.So the final count is 3, which matches the example.Another test case: example 2. Input [60,60,60]Each time mod60 is 0. For each element:First 60: remainder 0. complement is 0. remainders_count[0] is 0. count remains 0. Increment count for 0 to 1.Second 60: remainder 0. complement is 0. remainders_count[0] is 1. So add 1 to count (count is 1). Increment 0's count to 2.Third 60: complement is 0. remainders_count[0] is 2. Add 2 to count (count becomes 3). Then increment to 3.So the total is 3, which matches the example.So the logic works for these cases.So the steps are:- For each time in the list:   compute remainder = time %60   complement = (60 - remainder) %60   add the count of complement in the remainders array to the result   increment the count for remainder in the arraySo the algorithm is O(n) time and O(1) space (since the array is fixed size 60).Now, how to implement this in Python.The function will take a list of integers, time, and return an integer.We can use a list of 60 zeros to track the counts.Initialize count =0remainders = [0] *60for t in time:    rem = t %60    complement = (60 - rem) %60    count += remainders[complement]    remainders[rem] +=1return countWait, yes. Because for each element, the current complement count is added to the total. Then the current element's remainder is added to the remainders list, so that future elements can check against it.Yes.So that's the code.Testing this code with the examples:Example 1:times = [30,20,150,100,40]Processing:30: rem=30, complement=30. remainders[30] is 0. count=0. Then add 30's count to 1.Then 20: rem=20, complement=40. remainders[40] is 0. count remains 0. add 20 to remainders.Then 150: rem=30. complement=30. remainders[30] is 1. So count +=1. Then rem=30 becomes 2.Then 100: rem=40. complement=20. remainders[20] is 1. count +=1 → total 2.Then 40: rem=40. complement=20. remainders[20] is 1. count +=1 → 3. Then rem40's count becomes 2.So returns 3. Correct.Another example:Input [60,60,60]. Each rem is 0.First 60: rem0. complement0. remainders[0] is 0. count remains 0. add 1 to rem0.Second 60: rem0. complement0. remainders[0] is 1 → count +=1 (total 1). add 2 to rem0.Third 60: rem0. complement0. remainders[0] is 2 → count +=2 → total 3. add 3 to rem0.Yes.Another test case: time = [20,40]. 20+40=60 → 1 pair. So code should return 1.Processing:20: rem20. complement is 40. remainders[40] is 0. count remains 0. rem20 becomes 1.40: rem40. complement is 20. remainders[20] is 1. count +=1. returns 1. Correct.Edge case: time = [60], returns 0.Yes.Another edge case: time = [30, 30, 30]. How?Each rem is 30. For each element:First 30: complement 30. count 0 → add 0. rem30 becomes 1.Second 30: complement 30. count +=1 (since rem30 is 1 → count becomes 1). rem30 becomes 2.Third 30: complement30. count +=2 → total 3. So output is 3.Wait, but (0,1), (0,2), (1,2) → three pairs. Each pair sums to 60, which is divisible by 60.

This complementary remainder is calculated as \`(60 - current_remainder) % 60\`.3. Count Pairs: As we process each song, check how many previous songs had the complementary remainder. This count gives the number of valid pairs ending at the current song. Accumulate this count to get the total number of valid pairs.This approach ensures we only traverse the list once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and constant space complexity O(1) due to the fixed-size array for remainders. Solution Code\`\`\`pythonfrom typing import Listclass Solution:    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:        remainders = [0] * 60        count = 0        for t in time:            rem = t % 60            complement = (60 - rem) % 60            count += remainders[complement]            remainders[rem] += 1        return count\`\`\` Explanation1. Initialization: An array \`remainders\` of size 60 is initialized to zero to track the count of each remainder when song durations are divided by 60.2. Iterate Through Songs: For each song duration, compute its remainder \`rem\` and the complementary remainder \`complement\`.3. Update Count: Add the count of songs that have the complementary remainder to the total count of valid pairs.4. Update Remainders: Increment the count of the current song's remainder in the \`remainders\` array.This method efficiently counts pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.deepseek_reasoning.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.deepseek_solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.ground_truth_solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],z={key:0},R={key:1};function j(i,e,n,d,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return s(),a("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 DeepSeek 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>o.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(s(!0),a(w,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(h,p)=>(s(),v(m,{key:p,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(s(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[o.isLoading?(s(),a("span",R,"Loading...")):(s(),a("span",z,"See more"))],8,N)):x("",!0)])}const P=u(W,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-35cc4671"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"deepseek/5.md","filePath":"deepseek/5.md"}'),X={name:"deepseek/5.md"},G=Object.assign(X,{setup(i){return(e,n)=>(s(),a("div",null,[k(P)]))}});export{H as __pageData,G as default};
