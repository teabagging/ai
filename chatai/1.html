rows and m columns. The cell in the i-th row in the j-th column contains a_{i, j} coins in it.Initially, both Alice and Bob are standing in a cell (1, 1). They are going to perform a sequence of moves to reach a cell (2, m).The possible moves are:   * Move right — from some cell (x, y) to (x, y + 1);   * Move down — from some cell (x, y) to (x + 1, y). First, Alice makes all her moves until she reaches (2, m). She collects the coins in all cells she visit (including the starting cell).When Alice finishes, Bob starts his journey. He also performs the moves to reach (2, m) and collects the coins in all cells that he visited, but Alice didn&#39;t.The score of the game is the total number of coins Bob collects.Alice wants to minimize the score. Bob wants to maximize the score. What will the score of the game be if both players play optimally?InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.Then the descriptions of t testcases follow.The first line of the testcase contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of columns of the matrix.The i-th of the next 2 lines contain m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^4) — the number of coins in the cell in the i-th row in the j-th column of the matrix.The sum of m over all testcases doesn&#39;t exceed 10^5.OutputFor each testcase print a single integer — the score of the game if both players play optimally.ExampleInput331 3 73 5 131 3 93 5 1147Output780NoteThe paths for the testcases are shown on the following pictures.

The goal is to find the maximum score Bob can get when both play optimally. Alice wants to minimize Bob&#39;s score, and Bob wants to maximize it. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down.First, the problem says that Alice moves first from (1,1) to (2,m). Then Bob does the same, collecting coins that Alice didn&#39;t take. The key is that Alice&#39;s path choice will block Bob&#39;s options. Since Alice wants to minimize Bob&#39;s score, she will choose a path that leaves the least possible coins for Bob. But Bob will then choose the best path possible given Alice&#39;s choice.So the main task is to determine which path Alice should take so that the maximum possible coins Bob can collect is minimized. Then, find that maximum value.Let me think about the possible paths Alice can take. Since the matrix has two rows and m columns, the path from (1,1) to (2,m) must move down exactly once and then move right as needed. Wait, no. The possible moves are right and down. So for example, Alice could go all the way right in the first row, then down and right again. Or she could go down immediately, then right all the way. Or any combination where she moves down once and right enough times to reach column m.Wait, but the path must consist of moving right and down. Starting at (1,1), to get to (2,m), she must move down exactly once. The path can be described by the point where she moves down. So for example, in a matrix with m columns, she can move right k times in the first row, then down, then right (m-1 -k) times in the second row, where k can range from 0 to m-1.So the possible paths for Alice are determined by where she switches from row 1 to row 2. For each possible split k (the column where she moves down), her path is fixed. Then, Bob will choose his path such that he takes the maximum possible coins not covered by Alice&#39;s path.But how do we model Bob&#39;s path? Bob&#39;s path can&#39;t collect any cells that Alice visited. So Bob&#39;s path must be such that all the cells he visits are not on Alice&#39;s path.Wait, but Bob&#39;s path is from (1,1) to (2,m) using right and down moves. So for Bob to collect coins not in Alice&#39;s path, he must take a path that doesn&#39;t overlap with Alice&#39;s path except possibly the starting and ending cells? No, because the starting cell (1,1) and ending cell (2,m) are part of both paths. Wait, no. Alice&#39;s path includes (1,1) and (2,m), so those are taken by her. So Bob can&#39;t collect those. Wait, no: the problem statement says that Bob collects coins in all cells he visited that Alice didn&#39;t. So if a cell is in both paths, Bob doesn&#39;t collect its coins.So for any cell that Alice has already taken, Bob doesn&#39;t collect it. So Bob&#39;s path must collect coins from cells not on Alice&#39;s path. So Bob&#39;s optimal path is the path from (1,1) to (2,m) that collects the maximum sum of coins in cells not covered by Alice&#39;s path.But Alice chooses her path to minimize Bob&#39;s maximum possible sum.So the problem reduces to: find the path for Alice (i.e., the split point k where she moves down) such that the maximum possible sum Bob can get by choosing his own path (given Alice&#39;s choice) is minimized.So for each possible k (the column where Alice moves down), compute the maximum sum Bob can collect, and then choose the k that gives the minimum of these maximum sums.The challenge is to compute this efficiently for large m (up to 1e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4).So, how to model this?Let&#39;s first model Alice&#39;s path for a given k.Alice&#39;s path for k: she moves right in row 1 up to column k, then down to row 2, then right from column k+1 to m. So the cells she covers are (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,k), (2,k), (2,k+1), ..., (2,m).Bob&#39;s path must be from (1,1) to (2,m), but he can&#39;t collect any coins from Alice&#39;s path. So his path can&#39;t use any of the cells in Alice&#39;s path except for (1,1) and (2,m), which are the start and end but are already taken by Alice. Wait, but according to the problem statement, Bob&#39;s path is the same as Alice&#39;s in terms of movement. So Bob&#39;s path will start at (1,1) and end at (2,m), but he collects coins only from cells that are not in Alice&#39;s path. So if Alice&#39;s path includes (1,1), then Bob can&#39;t collect that. Similarly for (2,m). So Bob&#39;s path can only collect coins from cells that are not in Alice&#39;s path.But Bob must move from (1,1) to (2,m) via right and down moves. So his path can&#39;t go through any of the cells that Alice took. Except maybe the starting and ending cells, but those are already taken by Alice. So Bob&#39;s path can&#39;t start at (1,1) if that&#39;s already taken by Alice. Wait, the problem says that Bob&#39;s path starts at (1,1) as well. But Alice&#39;s path starts there. So when Bob starts, he can&#39;t collect the coin in (1,1) because Alice already took it. So Bob&#39;s path includes (1,1) and (2,m) but he doesn&#39;t collect coins from those cells. So Bob&#39;s path must consist of cells that are not in Alice&#39;s path except for the start and end, but those are not counted.So Bob&#39;s path is a valid path from (1,1) to (2,m) using right and down moves, but he can only collect coins from cells that are not in Alice&#39;s path. So the sum Bob can collect is the sum of all cells in his path that are not in Alice&#39;s path.Wait, but the problem statement says: Bob collects the coins in all cells he visited, but Alice didn&#39;t. So if a cell is in Bob&#39;s path and not in Alice&#39;s path, he collects its coins. So Bob&#39;s path can include cells not in Alice&#39;s path, and those contribute to his score.So for each possible Alice&#39;s path (i.e., for each k), we need to compute the maximum sum Bob can collect by choosing his path such that he takes all cells in his path that are not in Alice&#39;s path.So how to model Bob&#39;s optimal path given Alice&#39;s k?Let&#39;s think about what cells are blocked by Alice&#39;s path. For Alice&#39;s path determined by k:- All cells (1,1) to (1,k) in row 1 are taken.- All cells (2,k) to (2,m) in row 2 are taken.So the cells that are not taken by Alice are:- Row 1: columns k+1 to m. So (1, j) where j &gt;k.- Row 2: columns 1 to k-1. So (2,j) where j &lt;k.So the available cells for Bob are (1,j) for j&gt;k and (2,j) for j&lt;k.But Bob&#39;s path must start at (1,1) and end at (2,m). So how can he move through the available cells?Wait, (1,1) is taken by Alice, so Bob&#39;s path starts there, but he doesn&#39;t collect that cell. Similarly, the end is (2,m), also taken by Alice.So Bob&#39;s path is constrained to move through the available cells. But how?Let me try to visualize. For example, if Alice moves down at column k, then the available cells for Bob are in row 1 from k+1 to m, and row 2 from 1 to k-1. But how can Bob&#39;s path pass through these?Wait, Bob&#39;s path must start at (1,1) which is in Alice&#39;s path. Then he can move right through row 1, but those cells up to k are blocked. So he can&#39;t take those. So Bob&#39;s only way to move is: since (1,1) is blocked, he must immediately move down to (2,1), but that&#39;s allowed only if that cell is available. Wait, if Alice&#39;s path is determined by k, then in Alice&#39;s path, (2,1) is part of row 2 from k to m. Wait no. Wait, Alice&#39;s path includes (2,k) to (2,m). So if k is, say, 3, then Alice&#39;s path in row 2 starts from column 3. So (2,1) and (2,2) are not in her path. So Bob can move to (2,1) if k is greater than 1.So for example, if Alice&#39;s k is 1: she moves down immediately. So her path is (1,1) → down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), ..., (2,m). The available cells for Bob are row 1 columns 2 to m (since k=1) and row 2 columns 0 (since j &lt;1 is none). Wait, j can&#39;t be less than 1. So row 2 has no available cells. So Bob&#39;s available cells are row 1 from 2 to m. But how can he reach (2,m) from (1,1) via these cells?Hmm. So in this case, Bob starts at (1,1), which is blocked. Then he can move right to (1,2), (1,3), etc., but eventually, he has to move down to row 2 to reach (2,m). But when he moves down from (1, m) to (2,m), that&#39;s allowed. But (2,m) is blocked by Alice. So he can&#39;t collect any coins from that cell. So his path is (1,1) → right all the way to (1,m), then down to (2,m). The cells he collects are (1,2) to (1,m-1), since (1,1) is blocked, (1,m) is blocked (because Alice&#39;s path for k=1 includes (1,1), (2,1) to (2,m). So (1,2) is not in Alice&#39;s path. Wait, no: when k=1, Alice&#39;s path in row 1 is (1,1). Then she moves down to (2,1), then right. So the cells in row 1 except (1,1) are not part of her path. So for Bob&#39;s path, he can collect (1,2), (1,3), ..., (1,m), but he must move down to (2,m). However, (2,m) is part of Alice&#39;s path, so he can&#39;t collect that.Wait, but Bob&#39;s path must be a valid path. So he can move right in row 1 up to (1,m), then down to (2,m). But (1,m) is in row 1, which is available only if k &lt;m. If Alice&#39;s k is 1, then for Bob, (1,2) to (1,m) are available. So in this case, Bob&#39;s path would collect all those cells except (1,1) and (2,m). So the sum would be a[0][1] + a[0][2] + ... + a[0][m-1] (assuming 0-based index here). Then, when he moves down to (2,m), that&#39;s Alice&#39;s cell, so he can&#39;t collect it. So the sum is sum of row 1 from column 2 to m.But Bob can&#39;t go down earlier, because in row 2, all the cells from 1 to m are part of Alice&#39;s path (since k=1). So he can&#39;t step into any cell in row 2 except (2,m). So the only possible path for Bob is to go right all the way in row 1, then down to (2,m).So in this scenario, Bob&#39;s maximum sum is the sum of row 1 from column 2 to m.But how do we model this for any k?Let me think again. For a given k, the available cells for Bob are:Row 1: columns j where j &gt;k.Row 2: columns j where j &lt;k.Because in Alice&#39;s path, row 1 is covered up to column k, and row 2 is covered from column k onwards.So Bob&#39;s path must start at (1,1) (blocked) and end at (2,m) (blocked). He can move through the available cells.But how can Bob&#39;s path go from (1,1) to (2,m) using only those available cells?Wait, since (1,1) is the start, but it&#39;s blocked. So Bob&#39;s path must start there. Then he can move down (to row 2, column 1), but only if column 1 &lt;k. Because in row 2, columns j &lt;k are available.Wait, so for example, if k is 3, then row 2 columns 1 and 2 are available. So Bob could move down to (2,1) (if k &gt;1), then right through row 2 up to column k-1 (which is 2), then move up to row 1 (but how? because moving up is not allowed). Oh right, moves are only right and down. So once Bob is in row 2, he can&#39;t go back up. So his path can be split into two parts:Either:1. Move down immediately (from (1,1) to (2,1)), then move right through row 2 up to column j where j &lt;k, then move right through row 1 from column j+1 to m, then down to (2,m). Wait, no, that&#39;s not possible. Once he moves down to row 2, he can&#39;t go back up. So once in row 2, he can only move right.So Bob&#39;s path can be:Option 1: Move down from (1,1) to (2,1) (if possible), then move right through row 2 as far as possible (up to column k-1), then right through row 1 (from column j where j&gt;k) to m, then down to (2,m). But how does he get from row 2 to row 1? He can&#39;t move up. So this path isn&#39;t possible.Ah, right, moves are only right and down. So once Bob moves down to row 2, he can&#39;t go back up. So he can only stay in row 2 and move right. But to reach (2,m), he can only move right. So once in row 2, he must proceed right to (2,m).But wait, (2,m) is part of Alice&#39;s path. So Bob&#39;s path can go through row 2, but he can only collect coins from cells in row 2 that are not in Alice&#39;s path.So for Bob, there are two possible paths:1. He moves all the way right in row 1 (as much as possible) until some column, then moves down to row 2 and proceeds to (2,m). But in row 1, he can only move in columns j &gt;k. So if k is 3, he can move in row 1 from column 4 to m. But he starts at (1,1), which is in row 1, but he can&#39;t collect any coins from there. So to get to row 1&#39;s available cells, he must move right from (1,1) through blocked cells (since (1,1) to (1,k) are blocked). But that&#39;s not possible. Because the path must consist of right and down moves. So Bob can&#39;t move right through the blocked cells in row 1. Wait, but the cells are blocked in the sense that Alice has already taken them, but Bob&#39;s path can still pass through them, but he can&#39;t collect their coins. Wait, no. The problem statement says Bob collects coins from cells he visited that Alice didn&#39;t. So Bob&#39;s path can include cells that Alice took, but he doesn&#39;t collect those. But the path must be a valid path from (1,1) to (2,m). So for example, Bob&#39;s path can go through (1,1) → right to (1,2) (if Alice&#39;s path doesn&#39;t include (1,2)), but if Alice&#39;s path does include (1,2), then Bob can&#39;t collect that cell. But he can still move through it. Wait, but the problem says Bob&#39;s path is the same as Alice&#39;s in terms of movement. So the path is a valid path, but the coins collected are those that are not in Alice&#39;s path. So Bob can move through any cells, but he can only collect coins from cells not in Alice&#39;s path.So for example, if Alice&#39;s path includes (1,2), Bob can move through (1,2) but he doesn&#39;t collect the coin there. So his path can pass through blocked cells (i.e., Alice&#39;s path), but he can&#39;t collect their coins.So the actual movement is allowed through any cells, but the coins collected are only those in cells not visited by Alice.This is a crucial point. So Bob&#39;s path can overlap with Alice&#39;s path, but he can&#39;t collect those coins. So Bob&#39;s optimal path is to choose a path that maximizes the sum of coins in cells not covered by Alice&#39;s path, along his path.So for each Alice&#39;s choice of k (split point), Bob&#39;s optimal path is the path that maximizes the sum of coins in the cells that are not in Alice&#39;s path and are along Bob&#39;s path.So the problem reduces to: For each k, compute the maximum possible sum of coins in Bob&#39;s path (cells not in Alice&#39;s path) along any valid path from (1,1) to (2,m). Then, choose the k that minimizes this maximum sum.The challenge is to compute this efficiently.Let&#39;s model this for a given k.For a given k, the blocked cells are:- Row 1: columns 1 to k.- Row 2: columns k to m.So Bob&#39;s path can pass through these cells, but he can&#39;t collect their coins. The coins he can collect are:- Row 1: columns j where j &gt;k.- Row 2: columns j where j &lt;k.So Bob&#39;s path starts at (1,1) (blocked) and ends at (2,m) (blocked). He can collect coins from cells in row 1 (j&gt;k) and row 2 (j &lt;k).So the possible paths for Bob are:Either:1. Move down to row 2 early (say, at column 1), then move right through row 2&#39;s available cells (j &lt;k). Then, after reaching column k-1, he must move right through the row 2&#39;s blocked cells (from k to m), but he can&#39;t collect any coins there. But he can&#39;t move up, so he can&#39;t collect any more coins once he is in row 2 beyond column k-1.Or:2. Stay in row 1 for as long as possible (j &gt;k), then move down to row 2. But how?Wait, Bob starts at (1,1), which is in row 1. But to reach row 1&#39;s j&gt;k columns, he must move right through j=1 to k, which are blocked. But he can&#39;t collect those coins. But he can move through them. So for example, Bob could move right all the way to (1, m), then down to (2, m). But in row 1, the only available coins are j&gt;k. So between j= k+1 to m. So the sum he collects would be the sum of row 1&#39;s j from k+1 to m.Alternatively, Bob could move down to row 2 at some column s (after moving right s-1 steps in row 1, which are blocked), then move right through row 2&#39;s available cells (j &lt;k). Then, proceed through row 2&#39;s blocked cells to reach (2,m).So the possible paths for Bob are:- Path 1: All the way right in row 1 (collecting j&gt;k), then down.- Path 2: Down immediately, then all the way right in row 2 (collecting j &lt;k), then right through blocked cells.These are the two possible options. Because once Bob moves down to row 2, he can&#39;t go back up. So for Bob, the maximum coins he can collect is the maximum between the sum of row 1&#39;s j&gt;k or the sum of row 2&#39;s j &lt;k.Wait, that&#39;s a key insight. Because Bob&#39;s path can either collect all the available coins in row 1 (right part) or all the available coins in row 2 (left part). Because once he moves down to row 2, he can&#39;t collect any of the row 1&#39;s coins. So the maximum possible sum is the maximum between the sum of row1&#39;s right part and the sum of row2&#39;s left part.So for a given k, the maximum Bob can collect is max( sum_row1_right, sum_row2_left ), where sum_row1_right is the sum of row1 from k+1 to m, and sum_row2_left is the sum of row2 from 1 to k-1.Then, Alice wants to choose k such that this maximum is minimized.So the problem reduces to:Compute, for all possible k (0 &lt;=k &lt;=m), the maximum between sum_row1_right and sum_row2_left, and select the k that minimizes this maximum.But wait, k can be from 0 to m. Because:- If k=0, then Alice moves down immediately. But wait, k is the column where she moves down. So for k=0, that&#39;s impossible. The possible k values are from 1 to m. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think:Wait, the path for Alice is that she moves right in row1 up to column k, then down, then right in row2 from k to m. So k can be from 1 to m. Because if k=1, she moves right once (from 1 to 1?), then down. Wait, maybe the initial position is (1,1), so moving right once would take her to (1,2). Then down to (2,2), then right to m.Wait, perhaps I&#39;m confusing the columns here. Let&#39;s re-express:The split point k is the last column in row1 that Alice visits. So for example, when Alice starts at (1,1), then she can move right some times, then down. So the split point is the column in row1 where she moves down. So if she moves down immediately, then the split point is 1 (since she didn&#39;t move right in row1). Wait, no. If she moves down from (1,1) to (2,1), then the split point is 1. So after moving down, she is in row2, column 1, then moves right to m.So for any split point k (the column in row1 where she moves down), k can be from 1 to m. Because moving down from row1&#39;s column k to row2&#39;s column k.So for k in 1 to m:sum_row1_right = sum of row1 from k+1 to m.sum_row2_left = sum of row2 from 1 to k-1.So the maximum of these two is Bob&#39;s maximum possible sum. Alice chooses k to minimize this.So the problem is to find the minimal possible value of max( sum_row1_right, sum_row2_left ) over all k in 1..m.So how to compute this efficiently?We need precompute the prefix sums for both rows.Let&#39;s denote:prefix1[i] = sum of row1[1..i]prefix2[i] = sum of row2[1..i]Then, sum_row1_right for k is prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]sum_row2_left for k is prefix2[k-1]So for each k, compute max( (prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]), prefix2[k-1] )The minimal of these max values over all k from 1 to m is the answer.Yes! Because this captures all possible split points. For each possible split k, compute the maximum of the two possible sums (Bob can choose to collect either the row1 right part or the row2 left part). Since Bob wants to maximize, he will choose the path that gives the higher sum. Alice must choose the split k that minimizes this maximum.So the answer is the minimum over k of max( (sum row1 from k+1 to m), (sum row2 from 1 to k-1) )So now, the problem becomes how to compute this efficiently for each test case.Let&#39;s see the example given in the problem.Sample Input 1:331 3 73 5 1Sample Output:7So m=3.Row1 is [1,3,7]. sum_row1 is 1+3+7=11.Row2 is [3,5,1]. sum_row2 is 3+5+1=9.For each k from 1 to 3:k=1:sum_row1_right = sum row1[2..3] =3+7=10.sum_row2_left = sum row2[0..0] (k-1=0, so nothing). So sum_row2_left=0.max(10, 0) =10.k=2:sum_row1_right = sum row1[3..3] =7.sum_row2_left = sum row2[1..1] =3.max(7,3)=7.k=3:sum_row1_right = sum row1[4..3] (which is 0).sum_row2_left = sum row2[1..2] =3+5=8.max(0,8)=8.So the possible max values are 10,7,8. The minimal is 7. Which matches the sample output.Another example in the input:Third test case:147Output is 0.So m=1. So Alice&#39;s path must be (1,1) → down → (2,1). So the split k=1.sum_row1_right = sum row1[2..1] → 0.sum_row2_left = sum row2[0..0] →0.max(0,0) =0.So the output is 0.So the approach works.Now, the algorithm is:For each test case:- Read m.- Read row1 as a list of m integers.- Read row2 as a list of m integers.Compute prefix sums for row1 and row2.For each possible k from 1 to m:sum1 = sum of row1 from k+1 to m → prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]sum2 = sum of row2 from 1 to k-1 → prefix2[k-1]current_max = max(sum1, sum2)keep track of the minimal current_max.The answer is the minimal of these current_max values.Now, the question is how to compute this efficiently, especially for large m (up to 1e5 per test case). Because for each test case, we need to loop through all possible k (from 1 to m) and compute sum1 and sum2, then take their max.But with m up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, but the sum of m over all test cases up to 1e5, this approach is O(m) per test case, which is acceptable.So the plan is:Implement the following steps:1. Precompute prefix sums for both rows.2. For each k in 1..m:   a. sum1 = row1&#39;s sum from k+1 to m → prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]   b. sum2 = row2&#39;s sum from 1 to k-1 → prefix2[k-1]   c. current_max = max(sum1, sum2)   d. keep track of the minimal current_max.3. Output the minimal current_max.Now, for the prefix sums, we can use 1-based indexing for easier handling.For example, prefix1[0] =0, prefix1[1] = row1[0], prefix1[2] = row1[0]+row1[1], etc. Similarly for prefix2.So in code:In Python:For a row like [a1, a2, a3], the prefix sum array would be [0, a1, a1+a2, a1+a2+a3].Then, sum from i to j (1-based) is prefix[j] - prefix[i-1].So for sum_row1_right when k is in 1..m:sum1 = prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]Because row1[k+1 ...m] is from index k+1 (1-based) to m. The sum is prefix1[m] - prefix1[k].Similarly, sum2 is the sum of row2 from 1 to k-1: prefix2[k-1].So code steps:Read t.For each test case:   Read m.   Read row1 as list of integers.   Read row2 as list of integers.   Compute prefix1:      prefix1 = [0]*(m+1)      for i in 1 to m:          prefix1[i] = prefix1[i-1] + row1[i-1]   Compute prefix2 similarly.   Then, initialize the minimal maximum to a large number.   For k in 1 to m:       sum1 = prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]       sum2 = prefix2[k-1]       current_max = max(sum1, sum2)       if current_max &lt; current_min:           current_min = current_max   Output current_min.This should work.Now, testing the sample input:Sample Input 2:331 3 93 5 1So m=3.row1: 1,3,9 → sum is 13.row2:3,5,1 → sum is 9.prefix1: [0,1,4,13]prefix2: [0,3,8,9]k ranges 1-3.For k=1:sum1 =13 -1=12.sum2 = prefix2[0] =0 → max 12.k=2:sum1=13 -4=9.sum2=prefix2[1] =3 → max 9.k=3:sum1=13-13=0.sum2=prefix2[2] =8 → max 8.The minimal among 12,9,8 is 8. Which matches the sample output of 8.Yes.So the code works.Now, code in Python:We need to read t test cases, each with m, then two rows.Read from stdin, process, and output.In code:Read t.For each test case:Read m.Read row1: list(map(int, input().split())).Read row2: list(map(int, input().split())).Compute prefix1 and prefix2.Compute the minimal max as above.Print the minimal.Now, edge cases.For m=1:row1 has 1 element, row2 has 1.For k=1:sum1 = row1[1..1] when k=1, sum is prefix1[1] - prefix1[1] =0.sum2 = prefix2[0] =0.max is 0.Which is correct.Another edge case: when k=0 is impossible. But since k ranges from 1 to m, it&#39;s handled.Another edge case: when all the possible sums are zero, except for one. For example, when m=2, row1 [0,0], row2 [0,0]. Then, whatever k is chosen, sum1 and sum2 are zero. So the answer is zero.So the code handles that.Now, the code.But in Python, for large m (1e5), building prefix arrays is manageable.So here&#39;s the code:Read t.Loop for t test cases:Read m.Read row1 as list.Read row2 as list.Compute prefix1 and prefix2:prefix1 = [0]*(m+1)for i in range(1, m+1):    prefix1[i] = prefix1[i-1] + row1[i-1]Similarly for prefix2.Initialize min_score to a very high value (like infinity).Loop k from 1 to m:sum1 = prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]sum2 = prefix2[k-1]current_max = max(sum1, sum2)if current_max &lt; min_score:    min_score = current_maxAt the end, print min_score.Yes.Now, let&#39;s test the sample inputs.Sample 1:Test case 1:m=3.row1: 1 3 7 → [1,3,7]prefix1 is [0,1,4,11].row2:3 5 1 → [3,5,1].prefix2 is [0,3,8,9].k=1:sum1=11-1=10.sum2=0 → max 10.k=2:sum1=11-4=7.sum2=3 → max 7.k=3:sum1=11-11=0.sum2=8 → max 8.So min is 7.Sample 2:m=3.row1:1 3 9 → [1,3,9].prefix1: 0,1,4,13.row2:3 5 1 → prefix2:0,3,8,9.k=1: sum1=13-1=12, sum2=0 → 12.k=2: sum1=13-4=9, sum2=3 →9.k=3: sum1=0, sum2=8 →8.Min is 8.Third test case: m=1.row1:4 → prefix1[1] =4.row2:7 → prefix2[1]=7.k=1:sum1=4-4=0.sum2= prefix2[0] =0.max 0.So output 0.All sample cases pass.Now, code:So the Python function will read input, process each test case as per above.Now, code:But the code must read from stdin and write to stdout. Also, handle multiple test cases.The code:Read t.For _ in range(t):    m = int(input())    row1 = list(map(int, input().split()))    row2 = list(map(int, input().split()))    # compute prefix1    prefix1 = [0]*(m+1)    for i in range(1, m+1):        prefix1[i] = prefix1[i-1] + row1[i-1]    # compute prefix2    prefix2 = [0]*(m+1)    for i in range(1, m+1):        prefix2[i] = prefix2[i-1] + row2[i-1]    min_score = float(&#39;inf&#39;)    for k in range(1, m+1):        sum1 = prefix1[m] - prefix1[k]        sum2 = prefix2[k-1]        current_max = max(sum1, sum2)        if current_max &lt; min_score:            min_score = current_max    print(min_score)Yes.This should handle all cases. Now, test the code with the sample input.Sample Input:331 3 73 5 131 3 93 5 1147Sample Output:780Which matches.So this code should work.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal paths for Alice and Bob on a 2-row matrix such that Alice minimizes the score Bob can achieve, while Bob aims to maximize his score. Alice moves first, and Bob follows, collecting coins from cells that Alice did not visit. Approach1. Problem Analysis:   - Alice and Bob start at (1, 1) and end at (2, m).   - Alice&#39;s path must move right in the first row, then down, and then right to the end of the second row.   - Bob&#39;s path will be determined by the cells Alice did not visit, aiming to maximize his score.2. Key Insights:   - For each possible split point `k` where Alice moves down from the first row to the second, compute the maximum score Bob can achieve by either collecting coins from the remaining part of the first row or the initial part of the second row.   - The optimal solution is to find the split point `k` that minimizes Bob&#39;s maximum possible score.3. Algorithm:   - Use prefix sums to efficiently compute the sum of coins in the first row from `k+1` to `m` and the sum in the second row from `1` to `k-1` for each split point `k`.   - For each test case, iterate through all possible split points and determine the minimum of the maximum scores Bob can achieve.

Recall that a palindrome is a string that reads the same way from the first character to the last and from the last character to the first. For example, the strings a, bab, acca, bcabcbacb are palindromes, but the strings ab, abbbaa, cccb are not.Let&#39;s define cost of a string as the minimum number of operations so that the string becomes beautiful, if in one operation it is allowed to change any character of the string to one of the first 3 letters of the Latin alphabet (in lowercase).You are given a string s of length n, each character of the string is one of the first 3 letters of the Latin alphabet (in lowercase).You have to answer m queries — calculate the cost of the substring of the string s from l_i-th to r_i-th position, inclusive.InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the string s and the number of queries.The second line contains the string s, it consists of n characters, each character one of the first 3 Latin letters.The following m lines contain two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) — parameters of the i-th query.OutputFor each query, print a single integer — the cost of the substring of the string s from l_i-th to r_i-th position, inclusive.ExampleInput5 4baacb1 31 54 52 3Output1201NoteConsider the queries of the example test.  * in the first query, the substring is baa, which can be changed to bac in one operation;   * in the second query, the substring is baacb, which can be changed to cbacb in two operations;   * in the third query, the substring is cb, which can be left unchanged;   * in the fourth query, the substring is aa, which can be changed to ba in one operation. </div><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>🧠:</span>Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of changes needed to make a substring beautiful. A beautiful string has no palindromic substring of length at least 2. Hmm. So, any two consecutive characters can&#39;t be the same, right? Because that would form a palindrome of length 2. Also, any three characters can&#39;t have the first and third the same, because that would be a palindrome of length 3. Wait, but if the first and third are the same but the middle is different, like aba, that&#39;s a palindrome. So the problem is to avoid any such occurrences.Wait, the definition says that a substring of length at least 2 should not be a palindrome. So, even a substring of length 3 or more can&#39;t be a palindrome. But, the minimal approach would be to ensure that no two consecutive characters are the same, and also that no three consecutive characters are such that the first and third are the same. Because if two consecutive are the same, that&#39;s a palindrome. If three consecutive are such that first and third are same, then the substring is a palindrome of length 3. So the beautiful string must have all consecutive characters different, and also no two characters two apart being the same. So for example, the string &quot;aba&quot; is invalid because the first and third characters are the same, forming a palindrome of length 3.Wait, but &quot;aba&quot; is a palindrome of length 3. So any beautiful string must not have such a substring. So, the constraints are:- For every i, s[i] != s[i+1] (to avoid 2-length palindromes)- For every i, s[i] != s[i+2] (to avoid 3-length palindromes)Wait, but a substring of length 3 that is a palindrome would require s[i] == s[i+2], and s[i] != s[i+1], but even then, the entire substring is a palindrome. So, to prevent any such possibilities, the beautiful string must satisfy both conditions: consecutive characters are different, and the next next character is also different. So, the problem reduces to finding a string (of the same length as the substring) where:1. For all positions, the current character is different from the previous (if any) and the next (if any).2. Additionally, for each position, the next next character (i+2) is different. Wait, maybe I&#39;m getting confused here. Let&#39;s think again.Alternatively, the beautiful string can&#39;t have any palindrome of length &gt;=2. So any two consecutive characters must be different. Because two same consecutive characters form a palindrome of length 2. Also, any three characters where the first and third are the same would form a palindrome of length 3. So in the beautiful string, we must have that:For all i from 0 to len(s)-2: s[i] != s[i+1] (no 2-length palindromes)For all i from 0 to len(s)-3: s[i] != s[i+2] (no 3-length palindromes)Wait, but if the first condition is satisfied (no two consecutive same), then the second condition ensures that there&#39;s no 3-length palindrome. Because a 3-length palindrome would require s[i] = s[i+2] and s[i+1] different. But even if the first condition holds (consecutive different), if s[i] = s[i+2], then the substring s[i..i+2] is a palindrome. So, both conditions are necessary.So, the beautiful string must satisfy both conditions. Therefore, any valid beautiful string must have all consecutive characters different, and also no two characters that are two apart being the same.So, the problem is to find the minimum cost to change the substring such that both conditions are met.But how do we model this? Because changing a character affects both its previous and next positions. For example, changing the i-th character affects the i-1 and i, i and i+1 pairs, as well as the i-2 and i, i and i+2 pairs.This seems like a dynamic programming problem. Because the choice of the current character depends on the previous two characters. Let&#39;s see:Let&#39;s model the state as the last two characters. For each position, to choose a character that is different from the previous character and different from the character two positions back. Because if the current character is same as previous, then we have a two-length palindrome. If it&#39;s same as two positions back, then the previous character and the current form a three-length palindrome (since the previous is different from the current, and the two positions back is same as current). So the state would need to track the previous two characters. Then, for each position, we choose a character that&#39;s not equal to the previous and not equal to the two-back.So, the DP state can be something like dp[i][a][b] representing the minimum cost to get to the i-th character, where the (i-1)-th character is a, and the i-th is b. Then, for each new character (i+1-th), we need to choose a c that is not equal to b (to prevent two-length palindrome) and not equal to a (to prevent three-length palindrome). Then, the cost is increased by the cost of changing the (i+1)-th character to c. Then, for each possible a and b (previous two characters), we track the minimal cost.This seems feasible. Let&#39;s see. Since each character can be one of 3 letters (a, b, c), the possible states are 3 (for a) * 3 (for b) = 9 possible states. For each position, we process these states. So the time complexity would be O(n * 9) for each query. But if we have m=2e5 queries, each with n up to 2e5, that&#39;s O(mn) which is 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.Wait, but the queries are about substrings. So the approach of precomputing some data structure and answering each query in O(1) or O(log n) time is needed. However, the constraints are tight. The problem allows n and m up to 2e5, so any O(n) per query is O(2e5 * 2e5) = 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.So, we need a way to precompute for all possible substrings, but that&#39;s impossible due to the number of possible substrings. So, we need a smarter approach.Wait, perhaps the minimal cost for a substring [l, r] is determined by the length of the substring. For example, if the length is 1, the cost is 0. If the length is 2, the cost is 0 if the two characters are different, else 1.Wait, but for longer substrings, it&#39;s more complicated. But maybe there&#39;s a pattern. Let&#39;s think about the possible beautiful strings.A beautiful string must have all consecutive characters different, and also each character must be different from the one two positions back. Let&#39;s model the possible patterns.For example, for a beautiful string of length 3:The first character is a, second is b. The third can&#39;t be a (since it&#39;s two positions back) and can&#39;t be b (since it&#39;s the previous). So the third must be c. So the pattern is abc.Another possibility is starting with a, then c, then b. So acb. Then the third character is b. So the third is different from the second (c) and different from the first (a), so allowed.Wait, but in this case, the third character is b. The first is a, third is b. So no three-length palindrome. So that&#39;s allowed.Wait, perhaps the pattern for a beautiful string must be such that each character alternates between three possible options, but in a way that avoids two and three-length palindromes. Let&#39;s see:The constraints are:For all i: s[i] != s[i+1]For all i: s[i] != s[i+2]So, if we have a sequence like a, b, c, a, b, c..., then each consecutive pair is different. Also, each character is different from the one two steps back. For example, a, b, c: s[0] = a, s[2] = c (different). Then s[3] = a, which is same as s[1] (b), but that&#39;s allowed. Wait, s[3] is a, which is two steps back from s[1] (b). Wait, s[3] and s[1] are not two steps apart. The two steps back for s[3] is s[1], and they are different (a vs b). So this sequence is acceptable. So the pattern a, b, c, a, b, c, ... would be a valid beautiful string.Alternatively, another possible pattern is a, c, b, a, c, b, etc. So the key is that each character must be different from the previous and two steps back. So the sequence has a period of 3, but can&#39;t repeat the same character every three steps.So for a beautiful string longer than 3, the only possible patterns are those that follow a cycle of 3 distinct characters. For example, the only possible patterns are the permutations of a, b, c in a way that each next character is different from the previous and the one two steps back. There are two possible such patterns for each starting pair:For example, starting with a and b:Next character must be different from b (so not b) and different from a (so not a). So must be c. Then the fourth character must be different from c and different from b (the previous two steps back). So the fourth can be a. Then fifth is b, etc. So the pattern is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, etc.Alternatively, starting with a and c:Next must be different from c and a, so must be b. Then next different from b and c, so a. Then different from a and b, so c. So the pattern is a, c, b, a, c, b, etc.So there are two possible patterns for each starting pair, but perhaps the total number of possible valid patterns is limited. Let&#39;s see:The starting characters must be two different letters. For the third character, it must be different from the first and second. Then the fourth must be different from the third and second (since the two steps back is the second). Wait, the fourth character must differ from the third (previous) and the second (two steps back). So for the pattern a, b, c:The next character (fourth) must differ from c (previous) and b (two steps back). So it can be a. Then fifth must differ from a (previous) and c (two steps back). So can be b. Then sixth must differ from b and a (two steps back). So can be c. So the pattern cycles every 3.So, for any valid beautiful string of length &gt;=3, the sequence must follow a periodic pattern of 3, cycling through three distinct letters. So the possible patterns are the two possible 3-cycles (the two permutations of a, b, c that form a cycle). For example, the pattern could be abcabc... or acbacb..., etc.Wait, maybe there are six possible patterns (since there are 3 choices for the first character, 2 for the second, and the third is fixed, leading to 3 * 2 * 1 =6 possibilities). But perhaps many of these are rotations of each other. For example, the pattern abc, bca, cab are different but all follow the same cyclic order. Similarly, the reverse would be another set. So perhaps there are two distinct groups: the forward cycle (a-&gt;b-&gt;c-&gt;a) and the backward cycle (a-&gt;c-&gt;b-&gt;a). Wait, but each of these cycles can be started in different positions, but the overall pattern remains the same. For example, starting with b in the forward cycle would give bca, then b again, etc. So perhaps there are two possible base patterns.Thus, for any substring of length k &gt;= 3, the minimal cost can be found by considering all possible 3-length periodic patterns and choosing the one that requires the least changes. For example, for each possible starting triplet (like &#39;abc&#39;, &#39;acb&#39;, &#39;bac&#39;, etc.), compute the number of mismatches when aligning the substring to that pattern, and take the minimal over all possible valid patterns.Wait, but how many possible valid patterns are there? Let&#39;s see. For a string of length k, the pattern must start with two different characters, then the third character must be different from the first and second. Then each subsequent character must be different from the previous and the one two steps back.So the possible patterns are all possible 3-cycles. For example, the two possible sequences are:- a → b → c → a → b → c → ...- a → c → b → a → c → b → ...Each of these is a valid pattern. So there are two possible base patterns. However, for any given substring, the minimal cost could be achieved by either of these two patterns, or any of their rotations. For example, the pattern could start with a, then b, then c, then a, etc. Or start with b, then c, then a, etc. Wait, but each of these is a rotation of the first base pattern. So for each possible starting character pair (a and b, a and c, b and a, etc.), there are two possible patterns (depending on the third character), but perhaps these can be grouped into the two base patterns.Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum between all possible 6 possible starting triplets (each of the 3 letters for the first character, each of the remaining 2 for the second, and the third is determined). But for longer strings, the pattern must follow the 3-cycle, so each starting triplet defines the entire pattern. But if the starting triplet is invalid (like a, b, a), then that&#39;s not a valid pattern.Wait, perhaps the only valid starting triplets are those where the three characters are all distinct. For example, &#39;abc&#39;, &#39;acb&#39;, &#39;bac&#39;, &#39;bca&#39;, &#39;cab&#39;, &#39;cba&#39;. But when building a valid beautiful string, after the first three distinct characters, the fourth must be different from the third and the second, which would be the same as the first. So for example, &#39;abc&#39; followed by &#39;a&#39; (since fourth character must differ from third &#39;c&#39; and second &#39;b&#39;, so &#39;a&#39; is allowed). Then the fifth would have to differ from &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39;, so &#39;c&#39; again. Wait, but then the sequence would be a, b, c, a, c, ... which would have the third and fifth characters as &#39;c&#39; and &#39;c&#39; if the fifth is c. Wait, no, fifth character is determined by the previous two: fourth is a, third is c. So fifth must differ from a (previous) and b (two steps back). So possible characters are c and ... wait, the previous is a (fourth character), two steps back is b (second character). Wait, the fifth character must differ from the previous (a) and the two steps back (the third character is c). Wait, the two steps back from fifth is the third character (c). So fifth must differ from a (previous) and c (two steps back). So fifth can be &#39;b&#39;. Then sixth must differ from &#39;b&#39; (previous) and &#39;a&#39; (two steps back, which is fourth character, &#39;a&#39;). So sixth can be &#39;c&#39;. Then seventh must differ from &#39;c&#39; (previous) and &#39;b&#39; (two steps back, fifth character), so &#39;a&#39;. So the pattern would be a, b, c, a, b, c, a, etc. Wait, but that&#39;s not the case here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let&#39;s re-examine.For the fourth character in the pattern starting with &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;:Fourth character is determined by:- It must differ from the previous (third character &#39;c&#39;), so can be &#39;a&#39; or &#39;b&#39;.- It must also differ from the two steps back character (second character &#39;b&#39;), so can be &#39;a&#39; or &#39;c&#39;.So the fourth character must be &#39;a&#39; (since &#39;c&#39; is invalid as it&#39;s the previous). So fourth is &#39;a&#39;.Then the fifth character must differ from &#39;a&#39; (previous) and &#39;c&#39; (two steps back, third character). So possible characters are &#39;b&#39; (since &#39;a&#39; is previous, &#39;c&#39; is two steps back). So fifth is &#39;b&#39;.Sixth character must differ from &#39;b&#39; (previous) and &#39;a&#39; (two steps back, fourth character). So possible characters are &#39;c&#39;.Seventh character must differ from &#39;c&#39; (previous) and &#39;b&#39; (two steps back, fifth). So possible is &#39;a&#39;.So the pattern is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So the pattern repeats every three steps. So the sequence is abcabcabc... which is a cycle of three.Similarly, if the starting triplet is &#39;acb&#39;, then the fourth character would be &#39;a&#39;, fifth &#39;c&#39;, sixth &#39;b&#39;, etc. So the pattern is acbacbacb..., repeating every three.So for any valid pattern, the sequence must follow a cycle of three distinct characters, with each next character determined by the previous two. Therefore, there are only two possible base patterns (like the forward and backward cycles), each with three possible starting points (like starting at a, b, or c in the cycle).But how many possible valid patterns are there? For example, for the forward cycle:The sequence can start as abc, bca, cab. Each of these is a rotation of the same cycle. Similarly, the backward cycle can start as acb, cba, bac.So, there are 6 possible patterns. For each possible starting pair (a, b), (a, c), (b, a), (b, c), (c, a), (c, b), the third character is determined. Then the rest follow the cycle. So each starting pair (with distinct characters) leads to a pattern that is one of the six possible. However, for the purposes of minimal cost, perhaps all six possibilities need to be considered. Because for a given substring, the minimal cost could be achieved by any of these patterns.Therefore, for each substring, the minimal cost would be the minimal number of changes required to convert the substring into any of the six possible 3-cyclic patterns. However, checking all six for each query is manageable if the per-query time is O(1) or O(6), which would be acceptable for m=2e5.But how do we compute the number of changes required for each possible pattern? Let&#39;s think.Each pattern is a periodic sequence with period 3. For example, the pattern abcabcabc... For a substring of length k, the pattern is determined by the starting triplet, which repeats every three characters. For example, if the pattern is abc, then the i-th character (0-based) is the (i mod 3)-th character in the triplet.Wait, but for the pattern starting with a, b, c, then the positions are:0: a1: b2: c3: a (since 3 mod 3 =0)4: b (4 mod3=1)5: c (5 mod3=2)So yes.Similarly, the pattern acb would give:0: a1: c2: b3: a (3 mod3=0)4: c (4 mod3=1)5: b (5 mod3=2)So, each possible pattern can be represented as a base triplet (like abc, acb, bac, etc.), and then the i-th character is determined by i mod3 and the triplet.So, for each possible triplet (all permutations of a, b, c with distinct characters), we can precompute for the entire original string s the prefix sums of the cost (number of changes required) if the string were to be aligned to that pattern. Then, for any query [l, r], we can compute for each of the 6 possible patterns the number of changes needed in that substring and take the minimal.But wait, how many triplets are there? Since the triplet must consist of three distinct characters. The possible triplets are all permutations of a, b, c. There are 6 permutations: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.Each of these 6 triplets defines a pattern that cycles every three characters. So for each of these 6 patterns, we can precompute a prefix sum array. Then, for a query [l, r], we can compute for each pattern the cost as the sum of the differences between the original substring and the pattern&#39;s characters in positions l-1 to r-1 (assuming 0-based), but using the pattern&#39;s i-th character (relative to the start of the substring) according to the pattern.Wait, but the pattern&#39;s character at position i in the substring depends on the position within the pattern. For example, the pattern abc would have, for the substring starting at position l, the first character of the substring (position l in s) must be a, the next b, then c, then a again, etc. So the pattern is based on the position within the substring, not the original string.Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Because for a substring [l, r], the pattern&#39;s first character (position 0 in the substring) is determined by the triplet. For example, triplet abc: the first character of the substring must be a, the second b, the third c, fourth a, etc. So the pattern is determined by the position within the substring, not the original string&#39;s position.So, for the substring, the cost for a particular triplet pattern depends on how the substring aligns with the pattern. For example, the first character of the substring must match the first character of the triplet, the second character the second, the third the third, the fourth the first again, etc.But the problem is that for the same original string, different substrings can start at different positions, so the same triplet pattern would require different characters for the same original position s[i], depending on where it&#39;s in the substring.This complicates the pre-processing. Because for each possible triplet pattern, we would need to precompute for each possible starting offset (mod3) the prefix sum. For example, a triplet abc can have three possible starting offsets: starting at position 0 (pattern starts with a), position 1 (starts with b), position 2 (starts with c). Wait, no. Wait, the triplet defines the sequence. For example, triplet abc has the pattern a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So, the starting offset in the substring determines which part of the triplet&#39;s cycle is applied. Wait, but the triplet is three characters. So, the pattern is fixed as per the triplet. For example, the triplet abc defines the pattern as the 0-th position is a, 1 is b, 2 is c, 3 is a again, etc. So, regardless of the original string&#39;s position, the pattern is applied to the substring&#39;s own indices. So for the substring starting at position l, the pattern&#39;s first character (substring index 0) is the first character of the triplet. The second character (substring index 1) is the second character of the triplet, etc.Thus, the problem is that for each possible triplet, and for each possible starting phase (i.e., how the substring&#39;s index mod3 aligns with the triplet), we need to precompute the cost. But since the triplet&#39;s pattern is fixed for the substring&#39;s indices, and not the original string&#39;s indices, this can&#39;t be preprocessed.Therefore, this approach is not feasible for the given constraints.Alternative approach: For each query, the substring has length k. The possible valid patterns for the substring are the 6 possible triplets, but the substring must follow the pattern for all positions.For example, for a substring of length 4, possible patterns are abc a, bcab, etc., but in reality, each triplet defines a pattern that must be followed exactly. So, for each possible triplet (6 options), and for each possible starting position (the triplet&#39;s first three characters), the entire substring must follow that pattern.But how do we compute the cost for each possible triplet pattern for a given substring?The cost for a triplet pattern is the sum of the number of characters in the substring that differ from the pattern. For example, if the substring is &#39;baacb&#39; (original example&#39;s second query), and the pattern is &#39;cbacb&#39; (as per the example), but that&#39;s a length 5 substring.Wait, the pattern in the example is &#39;cbacb&#39;, but according to the triplet approach, perhaps the pattern is cba c... So the triplet is cba, and the substring&#39;s indices would be 0: c, 1: b, 2: a, 3: c (since 3 mod3=0, so first character of the triplet), 4: b (mod3=1, second character). So the pattern would be c, b, a, c, b. So the substring &#39;cbacb&#39; would require the first character to be c, the second b, the third a, fourth c, fifth b. So the cost is the number of positions where the original characters differ from this pattern.Thus, for the substring, the cost for a particular triplet is the sum over all positions in the substring of whether the original character matches the pattern character (0 if matches, 1 otherwise).But the problem is that for a given triplet, the pattern for the substring depends on the substring&#39;s indices. For example, the first character of the substring (position 0) must be the first character of the triplet, the second (position 1) the second, the third (position 2) the third, the fourth (position 3) the first again, and so on.So, for a substring of length k, the cost for a triplet (t0, t1, t2) is the sum for i from 0 to k-1 of (s[l +i] != t[i mod3]).But since the substring can be up to 2e5 in length, and each query can be up to 2e5, checking all 6 triplets for each query would be O(m * 6 * k) time, which is 2e5 * 6 * 2e5 = 2.4e11 operations, which is way too slow.Thus, this approach is not feasible.Alternative idea: for each possible triplet (6 of them), precompute a prefix sum array where each element is 1 if the character matches the triplet&#39;s pattern at that position, else 0. Then, for a query [l, r], the cost for that triplet would be (r-l+1) - sum of matches in [l..r]. But the problem is that the triplet&#39;s pattern is determined by the position in the substring, not the original string. For example, the first character of the substring (original position l) must correspond to the first character of the triplet. The second character (original position l+1) to the second character of the triplet, etc. So the pattern&#39;s alignment is relative to the substring, not the original string.This complicates things because the prefix sum arrays would need to be aligned for each possible starting offset mod3. For example, for a given triplet, the pattern could start at offset 0, 1, or 2 mod3 relative to the original string. But the substring&#39;s starting position (l) can be arbitrary. So, the alignment of the triplet&#39;s pattern for the substring depends on the substring&#39;s starting position modulo 3.Wait, for example, consider a triplet abc. For the original string&#39;s position l, the triplet&#39;s pattern starts at position l as the first character of the triplet. Then, the next positions l+1, l+2, etc., follow the triplet&#39;s cycle. So, the alignment of the triplet&#39;s pattern is determined by the substring&#39;s starting position mod3. But since the substring is a contiguous range [l, r], the pattern&#39;s alignment for the substring is determined by the starting index (l). Wait, no. Because the substring starts at l, which is some position in the original string. But the triplet&#39;s pattern is applied to the substring&#39;s own indices, not the original string&#39;s indices. So, for the substring&#39;s index 0 (original position l), the triplet&#39;s first character is used. For index 1 (original position l+1), the triplet&#39;s second character, etc. Then, the pattern cycles every 3 characters. So, the alignment is determined by the triplet&#39;s pattern and the position within the substring.Thus, for the substring, the cost for a particular triplet is the sum over each position i in the substring of (original character at l+i != triplet[i mod3]).So, for each triplet, the cost for a substring [l, r] can be computed as the sum over i=0 to len-1 of (s[l+i] != triplet[i mod3]), where len = r-l+1.This can be rewritten as the sum over j from l to r of (s[j] != triplet[(j - l) mod3]).To compute this sum efficiently, we can precompute for each triplet, and for each possible offset mod3 (0, 1, 2), a prefix sum array.For example, for triplet abc:- For offset 0 (the substring starts at a position where the pattern starts with the first character of the triplet), the pattern&#39;s sequence is abcabc...- For offset 1 (the substring starts with the second character of the triplet), the pattern is bcabca...- For offset 2 (substring starts with the third character of the triplet), the pattern is cabcab...Thus, for each triplet, we need three prefix sum arrays, each corresponding to the pattern starting at a different offset (0, 1, 2). Then, for a query [l, r], the length is len = r - l + 1. The starting offset is (l - 1) mod3 (assuming 1-based indexing for the original string). Wait, but the original string&#39;s positions are 1-based. So, when the substring starts at position l (1-based), the first character of the substring is at position l. So, the offset for the triplet&#39;s pattern would be (0) mod3, because the first character of the substring is the first character of the triplet. So, the offset depends on the position within the substring. For example, in the substring&#39;s index 0 (original l), the pattern&#39;s index is 0. For index 1 (original l+1), pattern&#39;s index 1, etc. So, the pattern&#39;s index is (i) mod3, where i is the substring&#39;s index (starting from 0).But the original string&#39;s positions are 1-based, so for the substring [l, r], the length is len = r - l +1. The pattern&#39;s index for position j in the original string (l &lt;= j &lt;= r) is (j - l) mod3. So, for each j in l..r, the pattern&#39;s character is triplet[(j - l) mod3].Thus, for a given triplet, the sum is the number of positions j in [l, r] where s[j-1] (since original string is 1-based) does not equal triplet[(j - l) mod3].To compute this efficiently, we can precompute for each triplet and for each possible phase (0, 1, 2) a prefix sum array. The phase here refers to the value of (j - l) mod3 for j = l. Wait, perhaps not. Let&#39;s think.For a given triplet, the pattern for the substring is determined by the starting offset, which is (j - l) mod3, where j starts at l. So the starting offset is 0 mod3. Then, the next positions are 1, 2, 0, etc. So, the pattern is always starting at offset 0 for the substring. So, for a given triplet, the pattern&#39;s alignment is fixed relative to the substring&#39;s start. Therefore, for each triplet, we need three prefix sum arrays, each corresponding to starting the pattern at offset 0, 1, or 2 relative to the original string. Wait, maybe that&#39;s not correct.Alternatively, perhaps for each triplet, we can precompute three different prefix sum arrays, each corresponding to the pattern&#39;s phase in the original string. For example, phase 0: pattern starts at position 0 mod3. Phase 1: pattern starts at position 1 mod3. Phase 2: pattern starts at position 2 mod3. Then, for a substring starting at position l (original 1-based), the phase would be (l-1) mod3. Because in the original string, position l is at index (l-1) in 0-based. So for the original string, the 0-based index is j = original position -1. So, for the substring starting at l (original 1-based), the first character is j = l-1 (0-based). The pattern&#39;s index in the triplet is (j - (l-1)) mod3 = (0) mod3. So, the pattern for the substring is aligned to start at phase 0 relative to the substring. Therefore, the phase is determined by (l-1) mod3 in the original string.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose the substring starts at original position l=4 (1-based), which is 3 in 0-based. So the pattern&#39;s first character (substring index 0) is triplet[ (3 - (4-1)) mod3 ] = triplet[ (3 -3) mod3 ] = triplet[0]. Wait, I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, for each character in the substring, the pattern&#39;s index is (i) mod3, where i is the index within the substring (starting from 0). So for the original position j (1-based), the index within the substring is (j - l) (assuming l is 1-based). So for j=l, the substring index is 0. For j=l+1, it&#39;s 1, etc. So the pattern&#39;s index for j is (j - l) mod3. The character in the triplet is triplet[ (j - l) mod3 ].Thus, for the original string, each j in [l..r] (1-based), the triplet index is (j - l) mod3.Thus, the cost for a triplet is the sum over j from l to r of (s[j-1] != triplet[ (j - l) mod3 ]).So, how can we precompute this sum efficiently?For each triplet, we can precompute a 2D prefix sum array where for each position i in the original string (0-based), and for each mod3 value (0, 1, 2), we store the number of characters that do not match the triplet&#39;s character at (i - start) mod3, where start is the starting position of the substring. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for each triplet, precompute three separate prefix sum arrays, one for each possible starting mod3 value.For example, for triplet abc:- pre_sum0[i] = number of mismatches up to position i (0-based) when the pattern starts with phase 0 (i.e., the pattern&#39;s index is (current position - start) mod3, where start is such that (start) mod3 is 0). But this depends on the start position of the substring.Alternatively, for each position i in the original string (0-based), for each triplet, and for each possible mod3 value (0, 1, 2), precompute whether the character at i matches the triplet&#39;s character at (i - s) mod3, where s is the start of the substring. But since s can vary, this seems tricky.Alternatively, for each triplet, precompute three prefix sum arrays. Each array corresponds to the pattern aligned with a different phase. For example:For the triplet abc:- phase 0: the pattern is a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So for any position i in the original string (0-based), the expected character is abc[i mod3].- phase 1: the pattern starts at the second character of the triplet. So expected character is abc[(i + 1) mod3]. Because, if the substring starts at a position s where s mod3 = 0, then the first character is a. If the substring starts at s mod3 =1, then the first character is b, which is abc[(0 +1) mod3]. So, for phase p (0,1,2), the expected character at position i is abc[(i - s) mod3], where s is the starting position of the substring. However, since s can vary, this depends on s.But we need a way to compute for any substring [l, r] (original 1-based) the sum over j=l to r of (s[j-1] != triplet[ (j-l) mod3 ]). Let&#39;s make j start from l to r. For each j, the original 0-based index is j-1. The (j-l) mod3 is the index into the triplet&#39;s pattern. So the sum is sum_{x=0}^{len-1} (s[l-1 + x] != triplet[x mod3 ]), where len = r - l + 1.This sum can be rewritten as sum_{x=0}^{len-1} (s[(l-1) + x] != triplet[x mod3 ]).This is equivalent to sum_{i=0}^{len-1} (s[ (l-1) + i ] != triplet[ i mod3 ] ), where i is the offset from the start of the substring.To compute this sum, we can model it as a sliding window where the pattern is fixed for the substring&#39;s indices. But how to precompute this efficiently.An alternative approach is to precompute for each triplet, and for each possible position in the original string, three arrays:For triplet T and phase p (0,1,2), the array pre_sum[T][p][i] is the number of mismatches in the first i characters when the pattern T is aligned with phase p (i.e., the character at position j in the original string is compared to T[(j - p) mod3]).Wait, but this might work. For example, if phase p is 0, then the pattern for the original string is T[0], T[1], T[2], T[0], T[1], T[2], etc. If phase p is 1, then the pattern starts at T[1], T[2], T[0], etc. So for each j in the original string (0-based), the expected character is T[ (j - p) mod3 ].Wait, no. Let&#39;s think: for phase p=0, the pattern is T[0], T[1], T[2], T[0], ... So for j=0, expected T[0], j=1 T[1], j=2 T[2], j=3 T[0], etc. For phase p=1, the pattern starts at T[1] for j=0: (j - p) mod3 = (0-1) mod3 = (-1) mod3 = 2 → T[2]. But that&#39;s not right. Hmm.Alternatively, phase p represents the offset added to j. For example, for phase p, the expected character is T[ (j + p) mod3 ].But I&#39;m not sure. Let&#39;s think again.We need to model the expected pattern for the substring [l, r] as T[0], T[1], T[2], T[0], T[1], etc. For each position j in the original string, when j is part of the substring starting at l (original 1-based, 0-based: l-1), the expected character is T[ ( (j - (l-1)) ) mod3 ].So for the original string&#39;s position j (0-based), when part of a substring starting at l (original 1-based), the pattern&#39;s index is (j - (l-1)) mod3. So, for a given j and l, it&#39;s (j - (l-1)) mod3.But how can we precompute this for arbitrary l and j?This seems difficult. But perhaps we can find a way to represent this sum as a function of l and the length of the substring.Another approach: for each triplet T, create three prefix sum arrays, each corresponding to the pattern T starting at a different phase. For example:pre_sum_T0[i] is the number of matches (or mismatches) up to position i when the pattern is aligned such that the first character of the substring is T[0].Similarly, pre_sum_T1[i] is for when the first character is T[1], and pre_sum_T2[i] is for when the first character is T[2].But how do these arrays relate to the original string?Wait, for each position i in the original string (0-based), the pattern aligned with phase 0 would require that the character at i is T[i mod3]. For phase 1, the pattern would require that the character at i is T[ (i+1) mod3 ]. For phase 2, T[ (i+2) mod3 ].But this is not dependent on the substring&#39;s starting position. It&#39;s a fixed alignment for the entire original string. So, for example, if we precompute for triplet abc and phase 0, the expected characters are T[i mod3] for each i. For phase 1, T[ (i+1) mod3 ], and phase 2, T[ (i+2) mod3 ].Then, for a substring starting at l (original 1-based, 0-based: l-1), the pattern for the substring would start with T[0] at position l-1 (0-based). So, the pattern alignment is phase (l-1) mod3. For example, if l-1 is 0 mod3, then phase is 0. If l-1 is 1 mod3, phase is 1. If it&#39;s 2 mod3, phase is 2.Thus, for each triplet T, we can precompute three prefix sum arrays: sum_T0, sum_T1, sum_T2. Each sum_Tp[i] represents the number of mismatches up to position i (0-based) when the pattern is aligned with phase p.Then, for a substring [l, r] (original 1-based), which is from (l-1) to (r-1) in 0-based, the phase p is (l-1) mod3. For triplet T, the number of mismatches in this substring would be sum_Tp[r-1] - sum_Tp[l-2], if l-2 &gt;=0, else sum_Tp[r-1].But wait, this is for the entire original string being aligned to phase p. So, the pattern for the substring would be aligned such that each character in the original string at position j (0-based) is compared to T[ (j - (l-1)) mod3 ].But in the pre_sum_Tp arrays, we&#39;re comparing j to T[ (j + p) mod3 ] for phase p. So, this only works if p is (l-1) mod3.Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:If the phase p is (l-1) mod3, then the pattern alignment is such that for the original string&#39;s position j, the expected character is T[ (j - (l-1)) mod3 ].But (j - (l-1)) mod3 = (j mod3 - (l-1) mod3) mod3 = (j mod3 - p) mod3 = (j mod3 + (3 - p)) mod3.But this doesn&#39;t directly correspond to the pre_sum_Tp arrays which are based on T[ (j + p) mod3 ].Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let&#39;s define for each triplet T and each possible phase p (0, 1, 2), the prefix sum array sum_Tp[i] as the number of mismatches up to position i when the character at position j is compared to T[ (j - p) mod3 ].Then, for a substring starting at l (original 1-based, 0-based: l-1), the phase p is (l-1) mod3. Because for j = l-1, (j - p) mod3 = ( (l-1) - p ) mod3 = ( (p) - p ) mod3 = 0 mod3. So, the expected character at j = l-1 is T[0], which is the start of the triplet.For j = l, (j - p) mod3 = (l - p) mod3. But p = (l-1) mod3, so l = p +1 + 3*k. So, (l - p) mod3 = 1 mod3. So, the expected character is T[1], which is correct.Thus, the sum_Tp arrays for p = (l-1) mod3 would give the number of mismatches when the triplet&#39;s pattern starts at position l-1 (0-based) in the original string. So, for a substring [l, r] (original 1-based), the number of mismatches would be sum_Tp[r-1] - sum_Tp[l-2] (if l &gt; 1) or sum_Tp[r-1] (if l=1).Thus, for each triplet, we precompute three prefix sum arrays (for p=0, 1, 2), each of which is the number of mismatches up to position i when the pattern is aligned with phase p. Then, for each query, we compute the phase p = (l-1) mod3 for the triplet, and compute the number of mismatches in the substring [l-1, r-1] (0-based) using the corresponding prefix sum array.Once we have the number of mismatches for all six triplets, the minimal cost is the minimal number of mismatches.This approach has O(n * 6 *3) = O(18n) precomputation time, which is acceptable for n=2e5 (18*2e5 = 3.6e6 operations). Then, each query requires O(6) operations to check all six triplets and compute the minimal cost. For m=2e5 queries, this is 2e5 *6 = 1.2e6 operations.Thus, the total time complexity would be acceptable.So, the steps are:1. Generate all six possible triplets (permutations of a, b, c with distinct characters).2. For each triplet T, precompute three prefix sum arrays (sum0, sum1, sum2), where sum_p[i] is the number of mismatches up to position i (0-based) when the pattern is aligned with phase p.   sum_p[i] = sum_p[i-1] + (s[i] != T[ (i - p) mod3 ] )3. For each query [l, r], compute the length len = r - l +1. If len ==1, cost is 0. Else:   For each triplet T in the six possible:      phase = (l-1) mod3 (since l is original 1-based, l-1 is 0-based)      The number of mismatches is:         if l ==1: sum_T[phase][r-1]         else: sum_T[phase][r-1] - sum_T[phase][l-2]      cost_T = mismatches   The minimal cost over all six triplets is the answer.But wait, the pattern for a triplet T must be such that the resulting string is beautiful. For example, the triplet must have no two consecutive characters the same and no two characters two apart the same. But since the triplet is a permutation of a, b, c, all three characters are distinct, so the triplet itself is valid. And the pattern generated by repeating the triplet ensures that consecutive characters are different (since triplet[0] != triplet[1], triplet[1] != triplet[2], triplet[2] != triplet[0], etc.), and also no two characters two apart are the same (since triplet[0] != triplet[2], etc.). Thus, any triplet of three distinct characters will generate a valid beautiful string when repeated.Thus, considering all six triplets is sufficient.Now, let&#39;s test this approach with the example:Example input:5 4baacbQueries:1 3 → substring &quot;baa&quot; → length 3.For this substring, the possible patterns are the six triplets. For each, compute the number of mismatches.Let&#39;s take the triplet &quot;bac&quot;:Wait, the six triplets are all permutations of a, b, c. Let&#39;s list them: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.Let&#39;s compute for each triplet the cost.For the first query, l=1, r=3 (0-based positions 0, 1, 2). The substring is &#39;baa&#39;.The phase p is (1-1) mod3 = 0 mod3 =0. So for each triplet T, the pattern starts with T[0].For triplet abc: pattern is a, b, c. The substring is b, a, a.Mismatches:0: s[0] = &#39;b&#39; vs a → 1.1: &#39;a&#39; vs b → 1.2: &#39;a&#39; vs c → 1.Total mismatches: 3. Cost 3.But the example says the minimal cost is 1, achieved by changing to &#39;bac&#39;. So perhaps another triplet.Wait, triplet bac: the pattern would be b, a, c. For positions 0, 1, 2:0: b matches → 0.1: a matches → 0.2: a vs c → 1.Total cost 1. Which matches the example.So, for this triplet, the cost is 1.Thus, the approach works.Now, to implement this:First, generate the six triplets.Then, for each triplet, precompute the three prefix sums for phases 0, 1, 2.For each query, compute phase p = (l-1) mod3. For each triplet, compute the number of mismatches in the substring using the corresponding prefix sum array.Finally, take the minimal cost among all six triplets.Now, the code:The steps in code:Read n, m.Read s as a string.Generate all six possible triplets.For each triplet, precompute three prefix arrays (sum0, sum1, sum2).For each query:   l, r = input (1-based)   len = r - l +1.   if len ==1: print 0.   else:      min_cost = infinity      phase = (l-1) %3      for each triplet in triplets:          prefix = sum_T_phase array.          if l ==1:              cost = prefix[r-1]          else:              cost = prefix[r-1] - prefix[l-2]          if cost &lt; min_cost:              min_cost = cost      print min_costBut wait, the triplet&#39;s prefix arrays are for each phase 0, 1, 2. So for each triplet, we have three separate arrays. For example, for triplet &#39;abc&#39;, there are sum0_abc, sum1_abc, sum2_abc.But in code, we can represent this as a list of triplets, each with a list of three prefix arrays.But in Python, with n up to 2e5, and six triplets each with three arrays of size 2e5, the memory would be 6*3*2e5 =3.6e6 elements, which is manageable.Now, code:First, generate the six triplets:from itertools import permutations.triplets = list(permutations([&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;]))This will generate all 6 permutations.Then, for each triplet in triplets:precompute three prefix sums.For example, for triplet T:sum0 = [0]*(n+1)sum0[0] =0for i in range(n):    expected_char = T[ (i - 0) %3 ]    sum0[i+1] = sum0[i] + (s[i] != expected_char)Similarly for sum1 and sum2.Wait, for phase p, the expected_char is T[ (i - p) %3 ].So for sum_p for triplet T:sum_p[0] =0for i in 0..n-1:sum_p[i+1] = sum_p[i] + (s[i] != T[ (i - p) %3 ])But wait, for phase p=0, it&#39;s T[ i mod3 ]p=1: T[ (i-1) mod3 ]p=2: T[ (i-2) mod3 ]Yes.So, code:In Python:n, m = map(int, input().split())s = input().strip()from itertools import permutationstriplets = [tuple(p) for p in permutations(&#39;abc&#39;)]prefix = [ [ [0]*(n+1) for _ in range(3) ] for _ in range(6) ]for t_idx in range(6):    T = triplets[t_idx]    for p in range(3):        prefix_sum = prefix[t_idx][p]        for i in range(n):            # expected character for position i (0-based) in phase p            expected = T[ (i - p) %3 ]            prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + (s[i] != expected)Then, for each query:for _ in range(m):    l, r = map(int, input().split())    if l == r:        print(0)        continue    min_cost = float(&#39;inf&#39;)    phase = (l-1) %3    for t_idx in range(6):        T = triplets[t_idx]        sum_p = prefix[t_idx][phase]        cost = sum_p[r] - sum_p[l-1]        if cost &lt; min_cost:            min_cost = cost    print(min_cost)Wait, but in the prefix array, prefix[t_idx][p][i] is the sum up to index i-1 (since for i in 0..n, prefix_sum[i] is sum for first i characters).Wait, no. For example, sum_p[i] is the sum for the first i characters. For s[0..i-1], sum_p[i] is the total mismatches. So for substring from l (1-based) to r (1-based), the 0-based indices are l-1 to r-1.So the sum is sum_p[r] - sum_p[l-1].Yes.So, the code should compute:cost = sum_p[r] - sum_p[l-1]But the prefix arrays are of size n+1, where sum_p[i] is the sum up to the (i-1)th character.Yes.Now, testing with the example:Sample input:5 4baacbQueries:1 3 → l=1, r=3. phase = (0) mod3=0.For triplet bac:The triplet is (&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;c&#39;).For phase 0, the expected characters for positions 0,1,2,3,4:i=0: (0-0) mod3=0 → &#39;b&#39;i=1: (1-0) mod3=1 → &#39;a&#39;i=2: (2-0) mod3=2 → &#39;c&#39;i=3: (3-0) mod3=0 → &#39;b&#39;i=4: (4-0) mod3=1 → &#39;a&#39;Original s is &#39;b a a c b&#39;So for positions 0 (b) → matches &#39;b&#39; → no cost.position 1 (a) → matches &#39;a&#39; → no cost.position 2 (a) → expected &#39;c&#39; → cost 1.sum_p for triplet bac, phase 0, up to position 3 (i=3) is sum of mismatches for positions 0,1,2.Which is 0 (b) + 0 (a) +1 (a vs c) → sum_p[3] =1.r=3 (0-based index 2) → sum_p[r] = sum_p[3] =1.l=1 (0-based 0) → sum_p[l-1] = sum_p[0] =0.cost =1-0=1, which matches the sample.Thus, this approach works.Thus, the code should handle all test cases correctly.The code seems correct. Now, implement it in Python.But note that permutations in Python are generated in a certain order. For example, permutations(&#39;abc&#39;) gives (&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;), (&#39;a&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;b&#39;), (&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;c&#39;), etc. The order may vary, but all six are considered.Thus, the code should work.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of changes required to transform a substring into a &quot;beautiful&quot; string. A beautiful string is defined as one that does not contain any palindromic substrings of length at least 2.  Approach1. Understanding Beautiful Strings: A string is beautiful if no two consecutive characters are the same (to avoid 2-length palindromes) and no character is the same as the one two positions away (to avoid 3-length palindromes). This means the string must follow a pattern where each character alternates in a cycle of three distinct characters.2. Possible Patterns: The valid patterns for a beautiful string are permutations of the three characters &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, and &#39;c&#39;. There are six possible permutations, each forming a valid cycle that avoids palindromic substrings.3. Precomputation: For each permutation (triplet) and each possible starting phase (0, 1, 2), precompute a prefix sum array that counts the number of mismatches between the original string and the triplet pattern starting at that phase. This allows efficient range sum queries for any substring.4. Query Processing: For each query, determine the phase based on the starting position of the substring. Use the precomputed prefix sums to quickly calculate the number of changes required for each triplet and return the minimum value. Solution Code```pythonimport sysfrom itertools import permutationsdef main():    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()        triplets = list(permutations([&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]))    triplet_count = len(triplets)        # Precompute prefix sums for each triplet and each phase (0, 1, 2)    prefix = [[[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(triplet_count)]        for t_idx in range(triplet_count):        triplet = triplets[t_idx]        for phase in range(3):            current = prefix[t_idx][phase]            for i in range(n):                expected_char = triplet[(i - phase) % 3]                current[i+1] = current[i] + (s[i] != expected_char)        for _ in range(m):        l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())        if l == r:            print(0)            continue        # Convert to 0-based indices in the prefix arrays        l0 = l - 1        r0 = r - 1        min_cost = float(&#39;inf&#39;)        phase = l0 % 3  # phase is (l-1) mod 3        for t_idx in range(triplet_count):            sum_p = prefix[t_idx][phase]            cost = sum_p[r] - sum_p[l0]            if cost &lt; min_cost:                min_cost = cost        print(min_cost)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation1. Precomputation: For each permutation of the triplet (&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;), we precompute three prefix sum arrays. Each array corresponds to a different starting phase (0, 1, 2) and counts the number of mismatches between the original string and the triplet pattern starting at that phase.2. Query Handling: For each query, we determine the starting phase based on the 0-based index of the substring&#39;s start. We then use the precomputed prefix sums to calculate the number of changes required for each triplet pattern starting at that phase. The minimum number of changes across all permutations is the result for the query.This approach efficiently handles up to 200,000 queries on strings of length up to 200,000 by leveraging precomputed data to answer each query in constant time.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-a99da172 data-v-6c2317d8><div class="review" data-v-6c2317d8><div class="review-title" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>❓:</span>&lt;image&gt;William has two numbers a and b initially both equal to zero. William mastered performing three different operations with them quickly.

The problem is about finding the minimal number of operations needed to turn a and b (starting at 0) into given c and d. The operations allow adding k to both, adding to a and subtracting from b, or adding to b and subtracting from a. Each operation uses a new k which can be different each time.Hmm, first, I need to figure out when it&#39;s possible to reach (c, d) and what the minimal steps are. Let&#39;s think about each operation&#39;s effect.Each operation can be represented as changes in a and b. Let&#39;s model them:1. Operation 1: a += k, b += k. So the sum (a + b) increases by 2k. But since k is positive, the sum can only increase here. Wait, no. Because in other operations, the sum might not change. Let&#39;s see:Operation 2: a +=k, b -=k. So the sum a + b remains the same as before. Because (a +k) + (b -k) = a + b. Similarly, operation 3: a -=k, b +=k. The sum remains the same.So sum changes only via operation 1, which adds 2k each time. So the sum&#39;s parity is important here.Wait, the initial sum is 0. After some operations, what can the sum be?Let&#39;s see:Each operation 1 adds 2k to the sum. Operations 2 and 3 don&#39;t change the sum.So the total sum after all operations is 2*(k1 + k2 + ... + km), where m is the number of times operation 1 is used. Because each operation 1 contributes 2k_i. The other operations (2 and 3) contribute 0 to the sum.The target sum is c + d. So c + d must be equal to twice the sum of the k&#39;s from operation 1. Because the sum after all operations must be c + d. Because initial sum is 0, and sum changes only via operation 1 steps. So the sum of all operation 1&#39;s 2k&#39;s must equal c +d.But wait, what if there are no operation 1s? Then sum must be zero. So c + d must be even? Or maybe that&#39;s only when sum is even. Wait, no. For example, if all operations are 2 and 3, then sum remains 0. So in that case, c +d must be zero.Wait, that&#39;s a key point. Let&#39;s restate:The sum c + d must be equal to twice the sum of all k&#39;s chosen in operation 1 steps. Let&#39;s call S the sum of the k&#39;s in operation 1. So c + d = 2S. Since S is a sum of positive integers (each k is positive), S must be at least the number of operation 1 steps. But perhaps S can be any sum as long as 2S = c +d.But S must be a non-negative integer. Wait, each k in operation 1 is positive, so S is the sum of positive integers. So 2S must be equal to c +d. Therefore, c +d must be even and non-negative. Wait, but if c and d are such that their sum is even but negative, but since they are given as non-negative (input says 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 1e9), the sum is non-negative. So, for (c +d) to be even, and that sum must be achievable via 2S. So S is (c +d)/2. But S must be ≥ the number of operation 1 steps. Because each k is at least 1. For example, if we have m operations of type 1, then S (sum of all k&#39;s) must be ≥ m. Because each k is at least 1. So sum k&#39;s &gt;= m. So 2S = c +d, which implies S = (c +d)/2. So if (c +d) is even and S &gt;= m (number of operation 1 steps), but how does that relate? Hmm, perhaps not directly. Maybe the key is that when using operation 1, each k is positive, but the sum can be any value as long as 2S = c +d.Wait, but in the other operations (2 and 3), after applying operation 1, how do they affect the differences?Let&#39;s model the problem. Let&#39;s suppose we have m operations of type 1, and the rest are operations of type 2 and 3. Let&#39;s see.Each operation 1 adds (k, k) to a and b.Each operation 2 adds (k, -k).Each operation 3 adds (-k, k).Wait, no. The three operations are:1. Add k to both a and b. So (a, b) becomes (a +k, b +k).2. Add k to a and subtract k from b. So (a +k, b -k).3. Subtract k from a and add k to b. So (a -k, b +k).So, the total change after all operations is:sum_op1 (k_i) + sum_op2 (k_j) + sum_op3 (-k_l) for a&#39;s total.sum_op1 (k_i) + sum_op2 (-k_j) + sum_op3 (k_l) for b&#39;s total.But perhaps another way to model this is to think of the total for a and b.Let’s denote:sum_op1 is S1 (sum of all k&#39;s in operation 1 steps).sum_op2 is S2 (sum of k&#39;s in operation 2 steps).sum_op3 is S3 (sum of k&#39;s in operation 3 steps).Then:a = S1 + S2 - S3b = S1 - S2 + S3Because:Each operation 1 adds (k, k) to (a, b). So S1 contributes to both.Each operation 2 adds (k, -k). So S2 contributes +k to a, -k to b.Each operation 3 adds (-k, +k). So S3 contributes -k to a, +k to b.So combining:a = S1 (from op1) + S2 (from op2) - S3 (from op3)b = S1 (from op1) - S2 (from op2) + S3 (from op3)So we have:c = S1 + S2 - S3 d = S1 - S2 + S3 We need to find S1, S2, S3 such that these equations hold, with S1 &gt;=0, S2 &gt;=0, S3 &gt;=0. Also, each S1 is the sum of the k&#39;s chosen in the operation 1 steps. Similarly for S2 and S3. But for each operation step, the k must be a positive integer. So S1 is the sum of m1 terms, each &gt;=1, where m1 is the number of operation 1 steps. Similarly for S2 and S3.But how does this relate to the variables m1, m2, m3 (counts of each operation type)?Because each operation&#39;s k is a positive integer. So for example, S2 is the sum of m2 terms, each &gt;=1. So S2 &gt;= m2. Similarly for S3 &gt;= m3. And S1 &gt;= m1.But the problem is to minimize the total number of operations, which is m1 + m2 + m3.So we need to find m1, m2, m3 and their corresponding S1, S2, S3 that satisfy the equations:c = S1 + S2 - S3 d = S1 - S2 + S3 And S1 &gt;= m1, S2 &gt;= m2, S3 &gt;= m3. Also, m1, m2, m3 are non-negative integers.Our goal is to find the minimal sum m1 + m2 + m3.Hmm. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s try to express S2 and S3 in terms of c and d.Adding the two equations for c and d:c + d = 2*S1 So S1 must equal (c +d)/2. Therefore, c +d must be even, otherwise it&#39;s impossible (since S1 is an integer). Also, since S1 is the sum of m1 terms each &gt;=1, S1 &gt;= m1.So first condition: c +d must be even. If not, output -1.Second condition: S1 must be &gt;=0, which is automatically true since c and d are non-negative, so S1 is (c +d)/2 &gt;=0.Wait, but if c +d is even but (c +d)/2 is not &gt;= m1, that could be a problem. But m1 is the number of operation 1 steps. So S1 is the sum of m1 terms, each &gt;=1. So S1 &gt;= m1. So (c +d)/2 &gt;= m1.But m1 is part of the variables we&#39;re trying to find. So perhaps we can express m1 in terms of S1. Since S1 = (c +d)/2, then m1 &lt;= S1. But since m1 is the number of operation 1 steps, each contributing at least 1 to S1, m1 can be at most S1.But how?Let&#39;s proceed. Once S1 is determined as (c +d)/2, the equations become:c = S1 + (S2 - S3)d = S1 + (-S2 + S3)Let&#39;s subtract S1 from both sides:c - S1 = S2 - S3 --&gt; equation Ad - S1 = -S2 + S3 --&gt; equation BAdding A and B: (c - S1) + (d - S1) = 0 --&gt; c +d - 2S1 =0. Which matches the earlier equation since 2S1 = c +d.Alternatively, let&#39;s subtract equation B from equation A:(c - S1) - (d - S1) = (S2 - S3) - (-S2 + S3) → c -d = 2S2 - 2S3 → (c -d)/2 = S2 - S3.So:S2 - S3 = (c - d)/2 Similarly, if we add equations A and B: (c +d - 2S1) = 0 → which is already known.Alternatively, we can express equations A and B as:Equation A: S2 - S3 = (c - S1)Equation B: -S2 + S3 = (d - S1)Wait, equation A is S2 - S3 = c - S1.Equation B is -S2 + S3 = d - S1 → S3 - S2 = d - S1.Adding equations A and B: 0 = (c +d) - 2S1 → which holds because 2S1 = c +d.So, these equations are dependent. So, the system reduces to S2 - S3 = (c -d)/2, but since S1 = (c +d)/2, then:(c -d)/2 = (c - (c +d)/2 ) → let&#39;s see: c - S1 = c - (c +d)/2 = (2c - c -d)/2 = (c -d)/2. Yes. So equation A becomes S2 - S3 = (c -d)/2.So S2 - S3 must equal (c -d)/2.But S2 and S3 are sums of their respective operations, each term at least 1. So S2 &gt;= m2 and S3 &gt;= m3.Now, we have:We need to find S2 and S3 such that S2 - S3 = (c -d)/2. Also, the sum of m2 and m3 (the number of operations of type 2 and 3) plus m1 (number of type 1) is minimized.But how do we model m2 and m3 here?Wait, m2 is the number of operation 2 steps. Each step contributes some k_i to S2 (sum of all type 2 k&#39;s). Similarly, m3 is the number of type 3 steps, each contributing to S3.But S2 can be any sum &gt;= m2 (since each k is at least 1). Similarly for S3.So S2 = m2 + x, where x is some non-negative integer (if all steps contribute exactly 1, then x is zero. But if some steps contribute more than 1, then x is the sum of the excess parts).Similarly, S3 = m3 + y, where y &gt;=0.But perhaps this is complicating things.Alternatively, for given S2 and S3, the minimal m2 is the number of steps for type 2: since each step contributes at least 1, the minimal m2 is the ceiling of S2 / something. Wait, no. For example, if S2 is 5, then the minimal m2 is 5 (if each step uses k=1), but if S2 is 0, then m2 is 0. Wait, but S2 is the sum of m2 positive integers. So if S2 is zero, then m2 must be zero. Otherwise, S2 &gt;= m2.Wait, but S2 is the sum of m2 terms, each at least 1. So S2 &gt;= m2. So m2 &lt;= S2. So for a given S2, the minimal possible m2 is 1 if S2 &gt;=1, but m2 can be as small as 1 if S2 &gt;=1. Wait, no. For example, if S2 is 3, then m2 can be 3 (each k=1), 2 (k=1 and k=2), etc. So the minimal m2 is 1, achieved by choosing k=3. Wait, because m2 is the count of operations. So for S2, the minimal m2 is 1 (if possible). For example, if S2 is 5, then the minimal m2 is 1 (k=5). So for any S2, the minimal m2 is 1 (if S2 is positive) and 0 otherwise. Similarly for S3.So the minimal possible m2 is 0 if S2=0, else 1.Ah! Because in one operation of type 2, we can add any k. So for S2, which is the sum of all k&#39;s in type 2 operations, if S2 is zero, then m2=0. Otherwise, m2 can be 1 (by using a single operation with k=S2). So for S2, the minimal m2 is 1 (if S2&gt;0) or 0.Same for S3: minimal m3 is 1 if S3&gt;0, else 0.So, the minimal total steps for m2 + m3 is the number of non-zero terms between S2 and S3.Wait, but how does S2 and S3 relate here?Given that S2 and S3 are determined by the equation S2 - S3 = (c -d)/2.Let me think. Let&#39;s denote delta = (c -d)/2. Then S2 = S3 + delta.But delta can be positive, negative, or zero.So, if delta is positive, then S3 = S2 - delta.But S3 must be &gt;=0. So S2 - delta &gt;=0 → S2 &gt;= delta.But delta can be (c-d)/2. Since c and d can be in any order, delta could be positive or negative.Wait, let&#39;s compute delta:delta = (c -d)/2.But S2 and S3 are sums of positive integers (or zero, if m2 or m3 is zero). So S2 and S3 are non-negative.So, for example, if delta is positive, then S3 = S2 - delta. Since S3 &gt;=0, S2 must be &gt;= delta.If delta is negative, then S2 = S3 + delta. Since S2 must be &gt;=0, S3 &gt;= -delta.But delta could be negative. So let&#39;s re-express:delta = (c - d)/2.Let&#39;s see. If c &gt;=d → delta is &gt;=0. Then S2 = S3 + delta. Since S3 &gt;=0, S2 &gt;= delta.If d &gt;c → delta is negative. Then S3 = S2 - delta → S3 = S2 + |delta|. Because delta is negative. So S3 is S2 + |delta|. But since S3 must be &gt;=0, this is possible as long as S2 is &gt;=0.But how can we model this?Let me consider all possible cases.Case 1: c +d is odd. Then S1 is not an integer. So impossible. So output -1.Case 2: c +d is even, but (c +d)/2 &lt;0. But since c and d are non-negative, their sum is non-negative, so S1 is non-negative. So this case is impossible.So the first condition is: if (c +d) is odd, output -1.Else, compute S1 = (c +d)/2.Now, the equations are:c = S1 + S2 - S3 d = S1 - S2 + S3 Which, as before, leads to S2 - S3 = (c -d)/2 = delta.So delta = (c -d)/2.Now, S2 and S3 must be non-negative integers. Because they are sums of k&#39;s, which are positive integers (or zero if no steps).Wait, no. S2 can be zero (if there are no operation 2 steps). So S2 can be zero, but if there are steps, then S2 is sum of positive integers.But S2 is the sum of all k&#39;s in operation 2 steps. So if there are no steps (m2=0), then S2=0.Similarly for S3.But in the equations:S2 and S3 can be zero, but how?Let&#39;s think. For example, if delta is zero (c=d), then S2 - S3 =0 → S2 = S3.So S2 and S3 can be zero (if m2=0 and m3=0), or any equal values. For example, S2=5 and S3=5, which can be achieved with one operation 2 (k=5) and one operation 3 (k=5), leading to m2=1, m3=1. Or alternatively, two operations: each contributes 5.Wait, but the minimal steps would be to have m2 + m3 as small as possible.So for S2 and S3, since S2 and S3 can be any non-negative numbers such that S2 - S3 = delta, but with minimal m2 + m3 (where m2 is 0 if S2=0, else 1, and similarly for m3).Wait, wait. Because m2 is the number of operations of type 2. Each operation contributes a positive k. So if S2 is 0, then m2 must be 0. If S2 is positive, then m2 can be 1 (since you can choose one k equal to S2). Similarly for S3.Therefore, for S2 and S3:if S2 &gt; 0 → m2 can be 1.if S3 &gt;0 → m3 can be 1.So the minimal m2 + m3 is:number of non-zero terms between S2 and S3.For example, if S2 and S3 are both zero → m2 + m3 = 0.If S2 is 5 and S3 is 0 → m2=1, m3=0 → sum 1.If S2 and S3 are both 5 → m2=1, m3=1 → sum 2.If S2 is 5 and S3 is 3 → m2=1, m3=1 → sum 2.So the minimal steps for m2 + m3 is the number of non-zero terms between S2 and S3. Because each non-zero S requires one step (using k equal to S).But wait, how?Because S2 is the sum of the k&#39;s for type 2 steps. So if S2 is 5, you can have one step with k=5 (m2=1) → sum S2=5. Similarly for S3. So yes, m2 is 1 if S2&gt;0, else 0. Similarly for m3.So the minimal m2 + m3 is the number of non-zero terms in S2 and S3.But how do we choose S2 and S3 to minimize this?Because S2 and S3 must satisfy S2 - S3 = delta, and both are &gt;=0.So, the problem reduces to finding S2 and S3 such that S2 - S3 = delta, S2 &gt;=0, S3 &gt;=0, and the sum (if S2&gt;0 then 1 else 0) + (if S3&gt;0 then 1 else 0) is minimized.But how?Let me think about possible scenarios.Scenario 1: delta =0.Then S2 must equal S3. So possible cases:a) S2 = S3 =0 → m2=0, m3=0 → sum 0.b) S2 = S3 =5 → m2=1, m3=1 → sum 2.So the minimal sum is 0, but only possible if S2=S3=0.But when can S2 and S3 be zero?If S2 = S3 =0 → delta=0. So yes.But in the equations for a and b:c = S1 + S2 - S3 → S1 = (c +d)/2. So if S2 = S3 =0, then c = S1, and d = S1.So c must equal d. Because S1 = (c +d)/2. So if c =d, then S1 =c =d.So in this case, if c =d, then S2 and S3 can be zero, leading to m2 + m3 =0. So the total steps is m1 (number of type 1 steps) +0.But what&#39;s m1 here?S1 is the sum of all type 1 steps. Each step contributes a positive k. So m1 is the number of steps. So S1 &gt;= m1.But S1 is (c +d)/2 = c (since c =d). So S1 =c.So m1 can be as small as 1 (if c&gt;0, and you choose k=c) → m1=1. Or if c is zero, then S1=0, m1=0.So if c =d, then:If c +d is even (which it is, since c=d), then:If c =d =0 → steps is 0.Else, possible options:- Use one type 1 step (k = S1 = (c +d)/2 = c) → m1=1, m2=0, m3=0. Total steps 1.But wait, let&#39;s check. For example, in the sample input, when c=6 and d=6. The sum is 12, so S1=6. So steps:Use one operation 1 with k=6. a and b become 6 and 6. So that&#39;s one step. Which matches the sample output for 6 6 → output 1.So this is the minimal steps.So in this case, when delta=0 (c=d), and S1 is c. Then m1 can be 1 (if S1&gt;0), or 0 (if S1=0).So the total steps is m1 + 0 (since S2 and S3 are zero). So:if c =d, and c +d is even (which it is):if c +d is zero (c=d=0) → steps is 0.Else steps is m1 (which is 1) +0 → total 1.So that&#39;s good.Now, scenario where delta is not zero.Case where delta is positive: c &gt;d.Then S2 = S3 + delta.We need S3 &gt;=0.So S3 can be any value &gt;=0, leading to S2 &gt;= delta.But we need to choose S2 and S3 such that the sum (m2 +m3) is minimized.But m2 is 1 if S2&gt;0, else 0. m3 is 1 if S3&gt;0, else 0.We need to choose S2 and S3 such that S2 = S3 + delta, and both are &gt;=0. Also, to minimize the sum of (S2&gt;0 ? 1 :0) + (S3&gt;0 ? 1 :0).So, possible options:If S3 is zero, then S2 = delta. Then:if delta &gt;0 → m2=1, m3=0. Sum is 1.Else if delta=0, but we handled that case earlier.So for delta positive:If S3 is zero, then sum is 1 (m2=1, m3=0). But S3=0 → possible.Alternatively, if S3 is positive, then sum could be 2 (m2=1, m3=1). Which is worse.So the minimal sum here is 1.But can this be done?Yes, if delta is positive. So in this case, set S3=0, S2=delta. Then m2=1 (since S2&gt;0), m3=0 (since S3=0). So sum is 1.But we need to check if that&#39;s allowed.But delta is (c-d)/2. So in this case, S2=delta = (c -d)/2.But S2 must be &gt;=0, which it is since c&gt;d.But also, in the equations:c = S1 + S2 - S3 → but S3=0, so c = S1 + S2. But S1 = (c +d)/2.So S2 = c - S1 → c - (c +d)/2 = (2c -c -d)/2 = (c -d)/2. Which is delta. So that&#39;s correct.Similarly, d = S1 - S2 + S3 → S1 - S2 = (c +d)/2 - (c -d)/2 = (c +d -c +d)/2 = (2d)/2 =d. Which is correct.So this works.So in this case, when delta is positive, we can choose S3=0 and S2=delta. Then m2=1 and m3=0. So steps for m2 +m3 is 1.Similarly, when delta is negative (d&gt;c), then delta = (c -d)/2 is negative. So S2 - S3 = delta → S2 = S3 + delta → but delta is negative. So S3 must be at least -delta. For example, let delta = -k where k is positive. Then S2 = S3 -k → S3 must be &gt;=k.So S3 can be k, leading to S2=0. Then:m3=1 (since S3=k&gt;0), m2=0 (since S2=0). So sum is 1.So in this case, when delta is negative, we can set S3 = -delta (since delta is (c-d)/2, which is negative, so -delta = (d -c)/2). Then S2=0. So S3 is (d -c)/2. Then:m3=1 (since S3&gt;0), m2=0. So sum is 1.So in both cases (delta positive or negative), we can choose S2 and S3 such that only one of them is non-zero, leading to steps of 1 for m2 +m3.So in all cases where delta is not zero, the minimal steps for m2 +m3 is 1.But wait, wait. What if delta is not an integer? For example, delta must be (c -d)/2. But c and d are integers, so delta is an integer only if c-d is even.But in our initial condition, c +d is even (since we have passed the first check). So if c +d is even, then (c +d) is even, and (c -d) is even if and only if c and d are both even or both odd. But not necessarily. Wait, for example, c=3, d=1. Then c +d=4 (even), c-d=2 (even). But c=3, d=2: c +d=5 (odd → already rejected). So in our case, since we passed the first check (c +d is even), delta is (c-d)/2, which is an integer. Because c +d is even and c -d is even → (c +d) and (c -d) are both even. Because if c and d are both even or both odd, then their sum and difference are even. So since c +d is even, c and d are of the same parity, hence delta is an integer.So delta is always an integer in the cases we are considering.So for delta positive (c&gt;d):We can set S3=0, S2=delta. Then steps m2=1, m3=0. Sum 1.For delta negative (d&gt;c):We can set S3= -delta, S2=0. Then steps m3=1, m2=0. Sum 1.For delta zero:We can set S2=0 and S3=0. Sum 0. But only possible if c =d.So in all cases where delta is not zero, the sum m2 +m3 is 1.But wait, let&#39;s see some examples.Sample input 1: 1 2. Output is -1.Wait, let&#39;s compute:c=1, d=2. sum is 3 → odd. So output is -1. Correct.Sample input 2: 3 5. Output is 2.Let&#39;s compute:c=3, d=5. sum is 8 → even. S1=4.delta = (3-5)/2 = -1.So delta is -1. So delta is negative. So we set S3 = -delta =1, S2=0.So S3=1, S2=0.Now, m1 is the number of steps for S1=4. S1 is 4, so m1 can be 1 (using k=4), sum steps 1.m2 +m3 is 0 +1 → 1.Total steps: 1+1=2. Which matches the sample output.Another example: 5 3 → c=5, d=3. sum 8 even. S1=4.delta = (5-3)/2 =1. So delta is positive. So S2=1, S3=0. m2=1, m3=0. m1=1. Total steps 1+1=2.Which matches the sample.Another sample: 8 0. sum is 8 even. S1=4.delta = (8-0)/2 =4. So positive. So S2=4, S3=0. m2=1, m3=0. m1 steps: S1=4 → m1=1. Total steps 1+1=2. Which matches the sample.Another sample: 0 0 → sum is 0. So S1=0. So m1=0. delta is (0-0)/2=0. So S2=0, S3=0. m2=0, m3=0. Total steps 0. Correct.So the approach is:For each test case (c, d):1. If c and d are both zero → output 0.Else:2. Check if c +d is even. If not → output -1.3. Else, compute S1 = (c +d)/2.4. Compute delta = (c -d)/2.5. Now, the minimal steps are m1 + (steps for m2 +m3).   For m1, since S1 is the sum of m1 steps of type 1 (each k &gt;=1), the minimal m1 is 1 if S1&gt;0. But if S1=0, m1 is 0.   So m1 is:   if S1 &gt;0 → m1 =1 (if S1 can be achieved with one step, i.e., k=S1).   But wait, if S1 is zero, then m1=0.   So m1 is 0 if S1=0, else 1.Wait, no. Because m1 is the number of type 1 steps. Each step contributes a k &gt;=1. So sum of k&#39;s (S1) is the sum of m1 terms, each &gt;=1. So S1 &gt;= m1. But since we can choose k&#39;s in any way, the minimal m1 is the minimal number of steps to sum up to S1.But to minimize m1, which is the number of type 1 steps, we can use a single step if S1&gt;0 (since we can choose k=S1). So for S1&gt;0, m1=1. For S1=0, m1=0.So m1 is 1 if S1&gt;0, else 0.So the total steps would be:m1 (0 or 1) + (steps for m2 +m3).Steps for m2 +m3 is:if delta is zero → 0 (if S2 and S3 are zero) else 2 (if delta is zero and S2=S3&gt;0). Wait, no. Wait, when delta is zero, S2=S3. So if S2 and S3 are both zero → steps 0. Else, steps 2 (since both are non-zero). But how?Wait, when delta is zero, then S2 must equal S3. So if we choose S2 and S3 to be zero → steps 0. Which is allowed only if c =d = S1. Because:c = S1 + S2 - S3 = S1 +0 -0 = S1 → since S1 = (c +d)/2, and c =d, then S1 =c =d. So yes.So if c =d and S1 =c, then:if c is zero → steps 0.Else, steps is m1 (1) +0 → total 1.But wait, in the case where delta is zero but S2 and S3 are non-zero, like S2=5, S3=5 → m2=1, m3=1 → steps 2. So in that case, total steps would be 1+2=3. But that&#39;s worse than the case where S2 and S3 are zero. So why would we choose that?We have to choose the minimal possible steps. So when delta is zero, the minimal steps for m2 +m3 is 0 (if S2 and S3 are zero) or 2 (if S2 and S3 are non-zero). So the minimal is 0, provided that S2 and S3 can be zero.So for delta zero:If S1 = c =d. Then c = S1 → S1 must equal c. Which it does.So S2 and S3 are zero.So steps for m2 +m3 is zero.So total steps is m1 (0 if S1=0, else 1) +0.So in this case, if c =d:- If c and d are zero → steps 0.- Else → steps 1 (from m1=1) +0 → 1.So in all cases where delta is zero (c =d) and sum is even, steps are 0 or 1.Which is correct.So putting it all together:For each test case:If c ==0 and d ==0 → output 0.Else:Check if c +d is even. If not, output -1.Else:Compute S1 = (c +d)/2.Compute delta = (c -d)/2.If delta is zero (c ==d):   Steps is 1 (m1=1) + 0 (m2 and m3 steps) → total 1.   But wait, if S1 is zero (c=d=0), then m1 is 0 → steps 0.   So in this case:   if S1 ==0 → steps 0.   else → steps 1.Else (delta !=0):   steps for m2 +m3 is 1.   m1 is 1 if S1&gt;0, else 0.   So total steps is (m1) + 1.But wait, S1 is (c +d)/2. So when can S1 be zero?Only if c +d =0 → c=0 and d=0. Which is already handled in the first case.So in the cases where delta is not zero (c !=d), and sum is even:S1 = (c +d)/2. Since c and d are non-negative and sum is even, S1 is non-negative.But if c and d are both zero, then delta is zero. So in cases where delta is not zero, S1 is &gt;=0, but can it be zero?For example, c=2 and d= -2. But since d can&#39;t be negative (input constraints say d &gt;=0), this case is impossible. So in the problem&#39;s constraints, when delta is not zero, S1 must be &gt;= (since c and d are non-negative and sum is even).Wait, for example, c=0 and d=4. sum is 4 → even. S1=2. delta is (0-4)/2 =-2. So delta is not zero. So steps would be m1 (1) + steps for m2+m3 (1) → total 2.But according to the code logic, yes.So, for delta !=0:steps = (1 if S1&gt;0 else 0) +1.But S1 can be zero only if c +d=0 → c and d are zero. Which is handled earlier.So when delta !=0, S1 is at least (c +d)/2. Since c and d are non-negative and sum is even and delta is not zero (so c !=d), then sum must be at least |c-d|.Because sum (c +d) = |c +d|. But c and d are non-negative, so sum &gt;= |c -d|.So S1 is (sum)/2. Which is at least (|c-d|)/2. Which is exactly |delta|. Since delta is (c-d)/2.But delta&#39;s absolute value is |(c-d)/2|.So in any case, S1 is (c +d)/2. Which could be zero only if c and d are zero. But that&#39;s already handled.So, for delta !=0, S1 must be &gt;= |delta|. Because (c +d) &gt;= |c -d| → (c +d)/2 &gt;= (|c-d|)/2 → S1 &gt;= |delta|.So, for delta !=0:steps = 1 (m1) +1 (m2+m3) =2.Wait, but wait:Wait, for example, c=3 and d=5. S1=4. delta= -1. So steps for m2+m3 is 1. m1=1. total steps 2.Which is correct.Another example: c=5 and d=3. delta=1. steps 1+1=2.Another example: c=8 and d=0. delta=4. steps 1+1=2.Another example: c=0 and d=0. handled earlier.But what about cases where S1 is zero but delta is not zero?But delta is (c-d)/2. If S1 is zero, then c +d=0 → c=0 and d=0. So delta is zero. So in cases where delta is not zero, S1 is non-zero.So when delta !=0, steps is 1 (m1) +1 (m2 +m3) → total 2.Wait, no:Wait, m1 is 1 if S1&gt;0. Since S1 = (c +d)/2. For delta !=0, c and d are not both zero, so sum can be zero only if c= -d. But since d &gt;=0, this would require c negative. But input constraints forbid that. So when delta !=0, sum is (c +d) must be positive. So S1 is positive. So m1 is always 1 in this case.So steps is 1 +1 =2.But in the sample input where the answer is 2, that&#39;s the case.So the code logic would be:For each test case:if c ==0 and d ==0 → output 0.else:if (c +d) is odd → output -1.else:if c ==d → output 1 (since m1 is 1 and m2 +m3 is 0).else:output 2 (since m1 is 1 and m2 +m3 is 1).But wait, let&#39;s test the sample input:Sample input 3:5 3 → output 2. Which matches.Sample input 4:6 6 → output 1. Which is handled by c ==d.Sample input 5:8 0 → output 2.Sample input 6:0 0 → 0.Yes.But wait, what about when c=1 and d=3?sum 4 → even. delta = (1-3)/2= -1.so steps: 1 (m1) +1 (m2 +m3) → 2. So output 2.But let&#39;s see:S1=2. delta=-1.So S3=1 (since delta is -1, S3 = -delta=1), S2=0.So equations:a = S1 + S2 - S3 → 2 +0 -1 =1 → correct.b = S1 - S2 + S3 → 2 -0 +1 =3 → correct.So yes. So steps are m1=1 (k=2 in operation 1), m3=1 (k=1 in operation3). So total steps 2.But according to the code logic, it&#39;s 2 steps. Correct.But what about a case where delta is 2 and S1 is 3. So steps is 1 +1=2.Yes.So the code logic seems to hold.But wait, what about when S1 is zero, but that&#39;s only when c and d are zero. So the code logic seems correct.So the minimal number of steps is:if (c and d are zero) → 0.Else:if (c +d) is odd → -1.Else:if c ==d → 1.Else → 2.But wait, let&#39;s think about another case: c=0 and d=2.sum is 2 → even. delta = (0-2)/2= -1.So steps: 1 (m1=1, S1=1) +1 (m3=1) → total 2.Yes.Another case: c=0, d=0 → 0 steps.Another case: c=2, d=2 → sum 4 even. delta 0. So steps is 1.But according to the code logic, yes.So the code logic can be written as:Read t test cases.For each case:c, d = map(int, input().split())if c ==0 and d ==0:    print(0)else:    if (c +d) % 2 !=0:        print(-1)    else:        if c ==d:            print(1)        else:            print(2)But wait, let&#39;s test the sample input.Sample input 2:3 5 → output 2.Sample input 3:5 3 → output 2.Sample input 4:6 6 → output 1.Sample input 5:8 0 → output 2.Sample input 6:0 0 →0.Yes.Another test case: c=0, d=4. sum is 4 even. delta= (0-4)/2 =-2. So output is 2.Which is correct.But what about c=4, d=0. sum is 4 even. delta= (4-0)/2=2. So output 2.Yes.So according to this logic, the code is correct.But why in the sample input where c=3 and d=5, the minimal steps is 2. Because:S1=4. delta =-1.So steps: m1=1 (operation 1 with k=4 → a=4, b=4).Then, operation 3 (add to b and subtract from a) with k=1. a=4-1=3, b=4+1=5. So two steps. Which is correct.Yes.So the code seems to work.But wait, what about a case where c=2 and d=4. sum=6 even. delta= (2-4)/2=-1.Output would be 2 steps. Let&#39;s see:Operation 1: k=3 → a=3, b=3.Operation 3: k=1 → a=3-1=2, b=3+1=4. So two steps. Yes.So the code is correct.Another test case: c=0, d=0 → output 0.But according to the code, yes.Another test case: c=5, d=5 → output 1. Which is correct.So the code seems to cover all cases.Thus, the minimal steps can be determined with this logic.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal number of operations required to transform two initial zeros (a and b) into William&#39;s favorite numbers c and d using three specific operations. Each operation involves a positive integer k, which can vary with each operation. Approach1. Identify Trivial Case: If both c and d are zero, no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.2. Check Parity: The sum of c and d must be even for it to be possible to reach (c, d) using the operations. If the sum is odd, output -1.3. Check Equality: If c and d are equal and non-zero, only one operation of type 1 (adding k to both) is needed, so the answer is 1.4. General Case: If c and d are different but their sum is even, the minimal number of operations is 2. This involves one operation of type 1 and another of either type 2 or 3, depending on the difference between c and d. Solution Code```pythonimport sysdef main():    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())    for _ in range(t):        c, d = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())        if c == 0 and d == 0:            print(0)        else:            if (c + d) % 2 != 0:                print(-1)            else:                if c == d:                    print(1)                else:                    print(2)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation1. Trivial Case: When both target values (c and d) are zero, no operations are needed.2. Parity Check: The sum of c and d must be even because each operation of type 1 changes the sum by an even number (2k), while operations of types 2 and 3 do not change the sum. An odd sum makes it impossible to reach the target values.3. Equal Targets: If c and d are equal and non-zero, using one operation of type 1 with k = (c + d) / 2 (which simplifies to c or d) will directly reach the target values.4. Different Targets: For different targets, two operations are always sufficient. One operation of type 1 adjusts the sum, and a subsequent operation of type 2 or 3 adjusts the difference between the two numbers efficiently.This approach ensures that we handle all possible cases optimally with minimal checks and operations, providing an efficient solution to the problem.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-a99da172 data-v-6c2317d8><div class="review" data-v-6c2317d8><div class="review-title" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>❓:</span>&lt;image&gt;William has an array of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

The problem is to find the minimal number of swaps needed to arrange the array such that no two neighboring elements have the same parity. And if it&#39;s impossible, return -1. Hmm.First, I need to figure out the conditions when it&#39;s possible. Because for the array to be arranged in the required way, the count of even and odd numbers must satisfy certain conditions. Like, if the length of the array is even, then there should be exactly half even and half odd. If it&#39;s odd, then one parity should have (n+1)/2 and the other (n-1)/2. Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible.Wait, right. Because in the desired arrangement, the parities must alternate. So for example, if the array starts with even, then the pattern is even, odd, even, odd, etc. Or starts with odd, then odd, even, odd, etc. So depending on the starting parity, the counts must match.So first step: check the counts of even and odd numbers. Let&#39;s call the count of even numbers even_count and odd as odd_count. Then:If n is even:even_count must equal odd_count. Otherwise, impossible.If n is odd:even_count and odd_count must differ by exactly 1. Otherwise, impossible.If that&#39;s not the case, then output is -1.Once that&#39;s satisfied, we need to calculate the minimal swaps required.But how?The swaps can only swap neighboring elements. So the problem is similar to rearranging the array so that even and odd alternate, with minimal adjacent swaps.But how to model this? Because each swap can only move elements one position at a time. So the minimal number of swaps would depend on the positions where the elements are in the original array compared to their desired positions.This feels similar to the problem where you have to arrange elements in a certain order, and compute the minimal swaps by considering the required positions and inversion counts. For example, the problem where you have to arrange elements as all even first or all odd first, and compute the required swaps by matching the current positions to the desired positions.So maybe here, the approach is to generate two possible desired parity sequences (if possible) and compute the minimal swaps required for each, then choose the smaller one.For example, possible desired sequences are:Option 1: even, odd, even, odd, ... (starting with even)Option 2: odd, even, odd, even, ... (starting with odd)But which of these are possible depends on the counts. For example, if even_count is more than odd_count, then the starting parity must be even.So the steps would be:1. Check if the counts are possible. If not, return -1.2. If possible, generate the two possible target sequences (if applicable). For example, if even_count equals odd_count (n even), then both options are possible. If n is odd, only one option is possible (the one with the majority count starting first).3. For each possible target sequence, compute the minimal swaps needed to arrange the current elements into that sequence.4. Take the minimum of the two options (if both exist), else take the only possible option.Now, the main challenge is to compute the minimal number of swaps required for a target parity sequence.How to compute that?Let&#39;s think: for a given target parity sequence (like even, odd, even, ...), we need to collect the indices where even numbers are placed in the current array, and compare them to the target positions. The minimal swaps required is equivalent to the number of inversions needed to move each even (or odd) to their target positions.For example, suppose the target sequence is even, odd, even, odd. Then the even elements must be in positions 0, 2, 4, etc. The odd in 1, 3, 5, etc.So, collect all the indices where even numbers are in the array. Then collect the list of target positions (like 0, 2, 4, ...). The minimal swaps required would be the sum of the absolute differences between each current index and target index, divided by 2? Wait, no. Wait, because when you swap adjacent elements, moving an element from position i to j requires |i-j| swaps. But if you have multiple elements moving, their required swaps can interfere. However, if the elements are to be arranged in a certain order, the minimal number of swaps is the sum of the differences between their current positions and their target positions, but adjusted for overlaps.Wait, perhaps the minimal number of swaps is the same as the inversion count when considering the required positions.Alternatively, the problem is similar to the problem where we have to arrange the even numbers in their target positions (like 0, 2, etc.), and the minimal number of swaps is the sum of the distances between the current positions of the even numbers and their target positions, but since each swap can only move one element one step, the sum is the sum of the absolute differences between each current even position and the target position for that even. But since elements are moving in the same direction, perhaps this can be considered as the required number of swaps.Wait, for example, suppose we have two even numbers at positions 1 and 3. The target positions are 0 and 2. So to move the first even from 1 to 0: 1 swap (swap with 0). Then the second even from 3 to 2: 1 swap. Total 2 swaps. The sum of (1-0) + (3-2) = 2. Which matches. So that&#39;s correct.Another example: even numbers at positions 3 and 1. Target positions 0 and 2. So first even is at 3, target 0. Second even at 1, target 2. Sum is (3-0) + (1-2) = 3-0=3, 1-2=-1. Absolute values sum to 4. Wait, but how would the swaps work? Let&#39;s see.Wait, the first even (at 3) needs to get to 0. But how?If the elements are:Indices 0 1 2 3Current: some even at 3, even at 1.Suppose the array is [odd, even, odd, even].The target is even at 0 and 2.So to move even from 1 to 0: swap with index 0. Then even from 3 to 2: need to swap index 3 and 2. But after moving the first even to 0, the array is [even, odd, odd, even]. Then the even at 3 needs to go to 2: one swap. Then from 2 to 1 (since 2 is even&#39;s target). Wait, no. The target positions for even are 0 and 2.Wait, the even at 3 is supposed to be at 2. So how many swaps? 1. Because moving from 3 to 2: swap once.The sum of the absolute differences is (3-2) + (1-0) = 1 +1=2. Which matches the swaps needed (swap 1 and 0: 1 swap, swap 3 and 2: 1 swap. Total 2.)So the sum of the absolute differences between the current positions and the target positions, for the even elements, gives the minimal number of swaps. Because each even has to move exactly |current_pos - target_pos| steps, and since they are moving in their own way, the steps add up.So the approach is:For each possible target parity sequence (even-start or odd-start), collect the current positions of the even and odd elements, and check if they can be arranged into the target positions.If the target is even-start, then the even positions are 0, 2, 4, etc. So for the even elements, their indices must be in these positions. For each even element in the array, collect their current indices. Then create a list of target positions (like [0, 2, ... ]). Then pair the current positions of the even elements (sorted) with the target positions (sorted), and compute the sum of |current_pos - target_pos| for each pair. The total sum is the number of swaps needed.But why sorted? Because the even elements need to be placed in the target positions in some order. To minimize the swaps, we should pair the smallest current position with the smallest target position, etc. For example, if the even elements are at positions 3, 5, and target positions are 0, 2, then pairing 3 with 0 and 5 with 2 would sum to 3+3=6. But pairing 3 with 2 and 5 with 0 would sum to 1 +5=6. Wait, same total. But perhaps in this case, the correct approach is to sort both the current positions and target positions and then pair them. That way, each even is moved to the earliest possible target positions.So, the steps are:For a target parity sequence (even first or odd first):1. Collect the indices where the elements have the correct parity. For even-first, even elements should be in even indices (0, 2, 4...). So for each even element in the array, check if their index in the target sequence is even. Wait, no. The target sequence is even, odd, even, etc. So the even elements must be placed at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). So the positions for even elements in the target sequence are even indices.So for the even-first scenario, collect all the even elements in the array. Then the target positions for these evens are 0, 2, 4, ..., (even_count-1)*2 if even_count is the number of even elements. Similarly for the odd-first scenario.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. Suppose we need to arrange the array as even, odd, even, odd, etc. Then the even elements must be placed at positions 0, 2, 4, etc. The number of even elements is (n+1)/2 if n is odd and even_count is (n+1)/2, else for even n, even_count is n/2.So, for the even-first case, the target positions for even elements are 0, 2, 4, ..., up to (even_count-1)*2. Similarly, for the odd-first case, the even elements are placed at positions 1, 3, 5, etc. So the target positions for even elements would be 1,3,5... etc., but the count depends on how many even elements there are.Wait, but for example, if the target sequence starts with odd, then even elements are placed in positions 1, 3, 5, etc. So if even_count is k, then the target positions are 1, 3, ..., 2k-1.So, for each possible target scenario (even-first or odd-first), we need to generate the list of target positions for even elements, collect the current positions of the even elements, sort them, sort the target positions, then compute the sum of absolute differences between each current even position and the target position. Similarly for the odd elements. But wait, since even elements are to be placed in their target positions, and the odds will fill in the rest, perhaps it&#39;s sufficient to only process the even elements.Yes. Because once the even elements are in their correct positions, the odds will be in their correct positions as well. Because the odds are placed in the remaining positions, which are exactly the required positions for the target sequence.So, the approach is:For each target scenario (even-first or odd-first):1. Generate the list of target positions for even elements.2. Check if the current even elements can fit into these target positions. Because the count of even elements must match the number of target positions. But this is already ensured by the initial check (the count condition).3. Collect the current positions of even elements, sort them.4. Sort the target positions (which are in order 0,2,4... or 1,3,5... so they are already sorted).5. Pair each current even position (sorted) with the target positions (sorted) and compute the sum of absolute differences. This sum is the total number of swaps needed.The minimal between the two scenarios (if both are possible) is the answer.So, putting this together.First, check if the counts are valid.Then, if possible, compute the required swaps for both possible scenarios (even-first and odd-first, if applicable), then choose the minimal.But when are both scenarios possible?Only when n is even and even_count = odd_count. In that case, both even-first and odd-first are possible, so we need to compute both and take the minimum.If n is odd, then only one scenario is possible. For example, if even_count is (n+1)/2, then even-first. Otherwise, odd-first.So the steps for each test case are:For each test case:1. Count the number of even and odd elements.2. Check if it&#39;s possible to arrange the array as required. If not, output -1.3. Else, generate the target scenarios (one or two) based on the counts.4. For each scenario, compute the required swaps.5. Take the minimal of the computed swaps (if two scenarios), else return the computed swap count.Now, how to implement this efficiently?Let&#39;s see. For each scenario:For even-first:The target positions for even elements are 0, 2, 4,... (even_count terms)For example, if even_count is 3, then 0,2,4.For odd-first:The target positions for even elements are 1,3,5,... (even_count terms). But even_count must be compatible. For example, if even_count is 3, then the positions are 1,3,5. But if the array length is 6 (even), then even_count must be 3 (since even_count = n/2). Then even-first requires 0,2,4, and odd-first requires 1,3,5. So even_count is 3, which fits.So the code steps:For each test case:Read n and array a.Compute even = list of indices where a[i] is even.even_count = len(even)odd_count = n - even_countCheck validity:if n is even:   if even_count != odd_count: impossible.else:   possible.else:   if abs(even_count - odd_count) !=1: impossible.   else:      possible.If impossible, output -1.Else:   generate possible scenarios.   scenarios = []   if n is even:      scenarios.append(&#39;even_first&#39;)      scenarios.append(&#39;odd_first&#39;)   else:      if even_count &gt; odd_count: # even is majority          scenarios.append(&#39;even_first&#39;)      else:          scenarios.append(&#39;odd_first&#39;)   For each scenario in scenarios:      generate the target positions for even elements.      For even_first:          target = [2*i for i in range(even_count)]      For odd_first:          target = [2*i +1 for i in range(even_count)]      sort the current even positions.      sort the target positions (though they are already sorted)      compute sum of |current[i] - target[i]| for all i.      store this sum.   if there are two scenarios, return the minimum of the two sums.   else return the sum.So, that&#39;s the plan.Now, let&#39;s test this logic against the example inputs.First example from the problem:Input:36 6 1n=3. even_count is 2 (6 and 6 are even), odd_count 1.n is odd. even_count - odd_count = 1. So possible, even_first scenario.target positions for even_first: even_count is 2. So [0, 2].current even positions are indexes 0 and 1 (the two 6&#39;s). sorted: [0,1].target positions sorted: [0, 2].sum is |0-0| + |1-2| = 0 +1 =1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the example.Second example:n=1. Array [9]. even_count is 0. odd_count 1. n is odd. possible. scenario is odd_first? Because even_count is 0. Wait, no.Wait, for n=1, which is odd, the even_count must be 0 or 1. Here, even_count is 0, so the scenario is odd_first (since the only element is odd, which is in position 0. But according to the scenario for even_first, even elements are placed at 0, 2, etc. But since there are no even elements, the scenario can be either? Wait, no. For n=1, the scenario is odd-first, because the parity sequence starts with odd (since even_count is 0, which is (n-1)/2). Wait, maybe the scenario is determined by the majority.In the code logic:if n is odd:   if even_count &gt; odd_count: even_first.   else: odd_first.In this case, even_count is 0, odd_count is 1. So even_count &lt; odd_count. So scenario is odd_first.But for the scenario, the even elements are placed at 1,3,5... but since even_count is 0, there are no even elements. So the target positions for even elements are empty. So the sum is 0. So the required swaps are 0, which matches the example.Third example:6 elements: 1 1 1 2 2 2.Original array:elements are:index 0: 1 (odd)1: 1 (odd)2:1 (odd)3:2 (even)4:2 (even)5:2 (even)even_count=3. n=6 (even). even_count=3, odd_count=3. So possible, two scenarios.Scenario even_first: target positions for even elements are 0,2,4.current even elements are at 3,4,5. sorted.sum: |3-0| + |4-2| + |5-4| = 3 + 2 +1=6.Scenario odd_first: target positions are 1,3,5. current even positions 3,4,5.sum: |3-1| +4-3| +5-5| → 2 +1 +0=3.So the minimal is 3. Which matches the example.Fourth example:n=2. array 8 and 6. Both even. even_count=2, n is even. So even_count must equal odd_count (2 vs 0 → invalid). So output -1.Fifth example:66 2 3 4 5 1.Original array:elements:index 0:6 (even)1:2 (even)2:3 (odd)3:4 (even)4:5 (odd)5:1 (odd)even_count=3 (indices 0,1,3). n=6 even. even_count must equal odd_count (3 and 3, yes).So two scenarios.Scenario even_first: target positions 0,2,4.current even positions sorted: 0,1,3.sum:0-0 → 0.1-2 → 1.3-4 →1. Total 2.Scenario odd_first: target positions 1,3,5.sum:0-1 →1.1-3 →2.3-5 →2. Total 5.So the minimal is 2, which matches the example.So the logic works.Now, the code.The steps in code:Read t test cases.For each test case:Read n, then the array.Compute even list (indices where a[i] is even).even_count = len(even).odd_count = n - even_count.Check if possible.If possible:   generate possible scenarios.   compute for each scenario the sum.   return the minimal sum.Else output -1.Implementing this.But for large n (up to 1e5), we need to process this efficiently.But for each scenario, generating the target positions is O(k), where k is even_count. For each test case, even_count can be up to 1e5, and t is 1e4. But sum of n across test cases is 1e5, so total O(1e5) for all test cases.Yes.Implementing the code:In Python, the code could be:Read t.For each test case:n = int(input())a = list(map(int, input().split()))evens = [i for i, num in enumerate(a) if num %2 ==0]even_cnt = len(evens)odd_cnt = n - even_cntpossible = Trueif n %2 ==0:    if even_cnt != odd_cnt:        possible = Falseelse:    if abs(even_cnt - odd_cnt)!=1:        possible = Falseif not possible:    print(-1)else:    # generate scenarios    scenarios = []    if n%2 ==0:        # even and odd can be first        scenarios.append(&#39;even&#39;)        scenarios.append(&#39;odd&#39;)    else:        if even_cnt &gt; odd_cnt:            scenarios.append(&#39;even&#39;)        else:            scenarios.append(&#39;odd&#39;)    min_swaps = float(&#39;inf&#39;)    for sc in scenarios:        if sc == &#39;even&#39;:            # target positions for even are 0, 2, 4..., even_cnt terms.            targets = [2*i for i in range(even_cnt)]        else:            # target positions for even are 1,3,5..., even_cnt terms.            targets = [2*i +1 for i in range(even_cnt)]        # current evens are sorted        curr = sorted(evens)        # compute sum of |curr[i] - targets[i]|        total = 0        for c, t in zip(curr, targets):            total += abs(c - t)        if total &lt; min_swaps:            min_swaps = total    print(min_swaps)Wait, but in the case where there are two scenarios (n even), then scenarios will have both even and odd. So the code will compute both and take the minimum.Yes.Testing this code against the examples.But what about the fifth test case:Input:66 2 3 4 5 1evens are at indices 0,1,3.even_cnt is 3.n is even, so scenarios are even and odd.Scenario even:targets for even are 0,2,4.curr sorted is [0,1,3].sum:0-0:01-2:13-4:1 → total 2.Scenario odd:targets for even are 1,3,5.sum:0-1:11-3:23-5:2 → sum 5.min is 2. So code returns 2.Which matches the example.So the code seems correct.But the code must be written as a function that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout. Also, since the code uses multiple test cases, and handles each in turn.The code provided in the assistant&#39;s answer would look like this.But note that in Python, for large inputs, using list comprehensions and such is efficient enough. The code will handle the constraints.So the final code is as follows.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal number of adjacent swaps required to rearrange an array such that no two neighboring elements have the same parity (even or odd). If it&#39;s impossible to achieve this arrangement, we should return -1. Approach1. Check Feasibility:    - For an array of even length, the counts of even and odd numbers must be equal.   - For an array of odd length, the counts of even and odd numbers must differ by exactly one.2. Generate Target Scenarios:   - If feasible, generate two possible target sequences (even-first or odd-first) for even-length arrays. For odd-length arrays, only one sequence is possible based on the majority count.3. Calculate Minimum Swaps:   - For each valid target sequence, calculate the required number of swaps by comparing the current positions of even numbers with their target positions. The minimal number of swaps is derived from the sum of absolute differences between current and target positions.

Swaps Calculation: For each valid scenario, we compute the minimal swaps by aligning the current positions of even numbers with their target positions using sorted indices and summing the absolute differences.This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal swaps required or identify impossibility, adhering to the problem constraints.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-a99da172 data-v-6c2317d8><div class="review" data-v-6c2317d8><div class="review-title" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>❓:</span>&lt;image&gt;William has a favorite bracket sequence.

I need to solve this problem where given a compressed sequence of brackets, I have to find the number of regular bracket subsequences. Hmm. The compressed sequence is given as a list of numbers where each odd index represents the number of consecutive &#39;(&#39;, and even is &#39;)&#39;. First, I should understand how the original bracket sequence is built. For example, if the input is [3,2,1,3], the sequence is &quot;((())))))&quot;. Wait, no. Let me think: the first element is c_1, which is odd, so 3 &#39;(&#39;. Then c_2 is even, so 2 &#39;)&#39;. Then c_3 is odd, 1 &#39;(&#39;, then c_4 even, 3 &#39;)&#39;. So the full sequence is &#39;((( ))( )))&#39;. Wait, no, concatenating all parts. So for c_1=3, it&#39;s &#39;(((&#39;, c_2=2 becomes &#39;))&#39;, c_3=1 is &#39;(&#39;, c_4=3 is &#39;)))&#39;. So the full string is &#39;(())))))&#39;? Wait, no. Let me recheck. Wait, the example in the problem says that the bracket sequence &quot;((())()))&quot; corresponds to [3,2,1,3]. Let&#39;s see: 3 &#39;(&#39;, then 2 &#39;)&#39;, then 1 &#39;(&#39;, then 3 &#39;)&#39;. So that&#39;s &#39;((( )) ( )))&#39;. Which is &#39;((( ) ( )))&#39;? Wait, that would be &#39;((())))&#39; which is 3+2=5, then 1+3=4: total length 3+2+1+3=9. The example sequence has 9 characters. The given example is &quot;((())()))&quot;. Wait, maybe the example sequence is not matching. Let&#39;s see: the sample input says the corresponding sequence is [3,2,1,3]. Let&#39;s break it down:c_1 is 3 → &#39;(((&#39;c_2 is 2 → &#39;))&#39;c_3 is 1 → &#39;(&#39;c_4 is 3 → &#39;)))&#39;So combining these gives &#39;((( ) ( ))))&#39;. Wait, that&#39;s 3+2+1+3=9 characters. So the sequence is &#39;((( ) ( ))))&#39; → which would be &#39;(())))&#39;? Wait, maybe I&#39;m getting the order wrong. Wait, c_1 is 3, so 3 &#39;(&#39;, then c_2 is 2, two &#39;)&#39;, then c_3 is 1, one &#39;(&#39;, then c_4 is 3, three &#39;)&#39;. So the sequence is &#39;((())))))&#39;? Let me count: 3 ( gives &#39;(((&#39;, then 2 ) gives &#39;))&#39;, then 1 ( gives &#39;(&#39;, then 3 ) gives &#39;)))&#39;. So the whole string is &#39;((( ))( )))&#39; → which would be &quot;((())))()))&quot;? Wait, no. Let&#39;s count the characters. 3 + 2 = 5, then 1 +3=4. So total 9 characters. So the example given in the problem is &quot;((())()))&quot;, which is 9 characters. Let&#39;s see:Breaking down &quot;((())()))&quot; into parts:First three &#39;(&#39;, then two &#39;)&#39;, then one &#39;(&#39;, then three &#39;)&#39;. Wait, let&#39;s see:Positions 1-3: ((( Positions 4-5: )) Position 6: ( Positions 7-9: ))) So the full string is &#39;((( )) ( )))&#39; → which is &#39;((() )))&#39;? Wait, perhaps I&#39;m miscalculating. But regardless, the problem is to model the original sequence as a series of alternating blocks of &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39;.The problem now is to find all continuous subsegments (substrings) of the original sequence that form a regular bracket sequence. Regular meaning balanced and properly nested. For example, &quot;(()&quot; is not regular, but &quot;()(())&quot; is.But given that the original sequence can be extremely long (since each c_i can be up to 1e9), we cannot construct the actual string. So any brute force approach that generates the entire string is impossible. We need a mathematical approach that works with the compressed representation.So the key challenge is to find all possible subsegments [l, r] (in the original string) that form a regular bracket sequence, but without constructing the actual string.Hmm. How can we model the compressed blocks to compute the possible regular sequences?Let me think about the structure of a regular bracket sequence. For a substring to be regular, it must be balanced (equal number of opening and closing brackets) and every prefix has at least as many opening as closing brackets.The approach for regular bracket sequences often involves using a stack-based method, tracking the balance. But since the string is in a compressed form, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the blocks.Each block is a group of consecutive &#39;(&#39; or &#39;)&#39;, depending on whether the index is odd or even.So the original string is a sequence of blocks: block 1 is &#39;(&#39;, block 2 is &#39;)&#39;, block 3 is &#39;(&#39;, etc.A substring [l, r] can start and end in the middle of a block. For example, if a block is 5 &#39;(&#39;, then a substring could start at the 3rd &#39;(&#39; of that block. But given that the blocks are very large (c_i up to 1e9), we can&#39;t process individual positions. We need to model this in terms of the blocks and how much of each block is taken.So the problem requires considering the possible ways a substring can start and end in the blocks and form a regular sequence.Let me think about possible regular sequences. A regular sequence must start with &#39;(&#39; and end with &#39;)&#39;, and the entire sequence is balanced. Also, during any prefix of the sequence, the number of &#39;(&#39; is greater than or equal to &#39;)&#39;.Given the compressed structure, perhaps the regular sequences are formed by certain combinations of the blocks, possibly starting and ending in the middle of a block.An alternative approach is to model the possible regular sequences by considering the starting and ending blocks, and how much of each is taken. But this seems complex.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering all possible pairs of blocks i and j, where i is an odd block (opening) and j is an even block (closing), and then calculate how many regular sequences can start in i and end in j.Wait, that&#39;s an interesting idea. Because any regular sequence must start with &#39;(&#39; (so in an odd block) and end with &#39;)&#39;, in an even block. So for each possible pair of opening and closing blocks, i (odd) and j (even), with i &lt;= j, we can compute the number of valid regular sequences that start in i and end in j.But how to do that efficiently?Let&#39;s consider two blocks i (opening) and j (closing). The substring must start in i and end in j, and in between, the blocks must form a valid sequence.Wait, but the substring can consist of a part of i, some full blocks between i and j, and a part of j. So, for example, i could be the first block, j the second. Then the substring would be some number of &#39;(&#39; from the first block and some number of &#39;)&#39; from the second. But that&#39;s the simplest case.Another example is when i is the third block (opening), j is the fourth (closing), and in between there&#39;s some other blocks. The substring would consist of some of the third block&#39;s &#39;(&#39;, some of the fourth&#39;s &#39;)&#39;, and any full blocks in between. Wait, no. Because the blocks are arranged in order. So between i and j, the blocks must be of alternating types. For example, if i is block 3 (odd, &#39;(&#39;), then j must be even (&#39;)&#39;), and the blocks in between (if any) must be even, then odd, then even, etc., but that&#39;s not possible because the sequence alternates between &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39;. Wait, the blocks are in order. So the blocks between i and j (if any) would be of even and odd alternately, but j must be even. So the blocks after i (if i is odd) must be even, then odd, then even, etc. So if i is 3 (odd), j is 4 (even), then between them there&#39;s nothing. If i is 3, j is 6 (even), then the blocks in between are 4 (even) and 5 (odd). So the substring would consist of some part of block 3, all of block 4, all of block 5, and some part of block 6. But how does that form a regular sequence?This seems complicated. Maybe we can model the problem by considering for each possible even j (closing block), all possible i (opening blocks) that could form a valid regular sequence when paired with j.Alternatively, for each even j, we can look back to previous opening blocks i (i odd) and compute how much they contribute to the total count.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using a stack approach, similar to how we find the longest valid parentheses substring. But again, given the compressed format, we need a way to compute this efficiently.Wait, here&#39;s another thought. The regular sequence must be balanced, so the total number of &#39;(&#39; equals the number of &#39;)&#39;. Also, during the traversal, the balance (number of &#39;(&#39; minus &#39;)&#39;) never becomes negative.Let&#39;s think of the original compressed blocks as a sequence of alternating &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39;. So, for example, block 1 is &#39;(&#39;, block 2 is &#39;)&#39;, block 3 is &#39;(&#39;, block 4 is &#39;)&#39;, etc.A substring that starts in block i (must be &#39;(&#39;) and ends in block j (must be &#39;)&#39;) will consist of:- A part of block i (some number of &#39;(&#39;s),- All blocks i+1 to j-1 (their full counts),- A part of block j (some number of &#39;)&#39;s).Wait, no. Because the substring could start in block i and end in block j, but there could be other blocks between i and j. For example, if i is 1 (opening), j is 4 (closing), then between them are blocks 2 (&#39;)&#39;) and 3 (opening). So the substring would include parts of 1, all of 2, all of 3, parts of 4. But in this case, the substring would have a sequence like some &#39;(&#39;, then all &#39;)&#39;, then all &#39;(&#39;, then some &#39;)&#39;. But such a substring would start with &#39;(&#39;, then have a lot of &#39;)&#39;, which may cause the balance to dip below zero early on, making it invalid.So, the problem is to find all possible combinations of starting and ending blocks, and the amount taken from those blocks, along with all the blocks in between, such that the overall sequence is balanced and all prefixes have non-negative balance.This seems quite challenging. Let&#39;s try to find a way to model this.First, note that the entire sequence must be balanced. So the sum of the opening brackets (from the parts taken) in all the opening blocks (i, i+2, etc.) plus the sum of the closing brackets in the closing blocks (i+1, j, etc.) must be equal.But this is not enough. The sequence must also be such that during traversal, the balance never drops below zero.Let me think of a possible approach. For each possible pair of i (opening block) and j (closing block), compute the maximum possible valid regular sequence that starts in i and ends in j, and then count how many such sequences exist for this pair.For example, let&#39;s say we&#39;re looking at i=1 (a &#39;(&#39; block) and j=2 (a &#39;)&#39;). Then the possible substrings are part of block 1 and part of block 2. The total number of &#39;(&#39; is a and &#39;)&#39;, which must be equal. So a = b. Also, during the traversal, the balance must not drop below zero.In this case, the maximum possible a is the minimum between c_1 and c_2. For example, if c_1 is 3 and c_2 is 2, then the maximum a is 2. So each possible a from 1 to 2 gives a valid regular sequence. So the count here is 2.Wait, but for each a, the sequence is a &#39;(&#39; followed by a &#39;)&#39;, and since it&#39;s continuous, the entire sequence is a single pair. So for a=1, the sequence is &quot;()&quot;, which is valid. For a=2, &quot;(() )&quot;, wait no. Wait, a is the number of &#39;(&#39; taken from block 1 and the same number of &#39;)&#39; taken from block 2. So the sequence would be &#39;a&#39; &#39;(&#39; followed by &#39;a&#39; &#39;)&#39;, which is a valid regular sequence. So the number of possible such sequences is the minimum of c_1 and c_2, and each a from 1 to that minimum contributes one valid sequence. So the total is min(c_i, c_j).But that&#39;s only true when there are no blocks between i and j. For example, if i and j are consecutive, then the entire substring is part of i and part of j. But if there are other blocks between i and j, how do they affect the count?For example, consider i=1, j=4. Between them are blocks 2 (&#39;)&#39;) and 3 (&#39;(&#39;). So the substring would include part of block 1, all of block 2, all of block 3, and part of block 4.Wait, but block 2 is &#39;)&#39;, which would cause the balance to drop. For example, let&#39;s say we take a &#39;(&#39; from block 1, then all of block 2&#39;s &#39;)&#39;, which is c_2. Then all of block 3&#39;s &#39;(&#39;, c_3, then some d from block 4&#39;s &#39;)&#39;.So the total &#39;(&#39; is a + c_3, and the total &#39;)&#39; is c_2 + d. For the sequence to be balanced, a + c_3 = c_2 + d. Also, the balance must never drop below zero.But during the traversal, after taking a &#39;(&#39; (from block 1), then c_2 &#39;)&#39;, which would decrease the balance by c_2. Then c_3 &#39;(&#39;, which increases the balance by c_3. Then d &#39;)&#39;, which decreases by d.So the balance steps would be:Start at 0.After a &#39;(&#39;: a → balance a.Then c_2 &#39;)&#39;: balance becomes a - c_2. This must be &gt;=0. Otherwise, the sequence is invalid.Then c_3 &#39;(&#39;: balance increases by c_3 → (a - c_2) + c_3.Then d &#39;)&#39;: balance decreases by d → (a - c_2 + c_3) - d.But since the entire sequence is balanced, a + c_3 = c_2 + d.So after the entire sequence, balance is zero.But during the traversal, the balance after the block 2&#39;s &#39;)&#39;, which is a - c_2, must be &gt;=0. Otherwise, the sequence is invalid.So, in this case, we need a &gt;= c_2. But then, the total number of &#39;(&#39; (a + c_3) must equal the total &#39;)&#39;, which is c_2 + d. So substituting d = a + c_3 - c_2.But d must be between 1 and c_4 (since we take some from block 4). So:d = a + c_3 - c_2.But d must satisfy 1 ≤ d ≤ c_4.So:1 ≤ a + c_3 - c_2 ≤ c_4.But also, a can be at most c_1 (since we take a from block 1).Additionally, after the block 2, the balance a - c_2 must be ≥ 0.So a &gt;= c_2.So combining all these:a must be &gt;= c_2,a &lt;= c_1,and a + c_3 - c_2 &gt;= 1 → a &gt;= c_2 - c_3 +1,and a + c_3 - c_2 &lt;= c_4 → a &lt;= c_4 + c_2 - c_3.But this seems complicated.But perhaps there&#39;s a way to find the range of a that satisfies all these conditions, and then the number of valid a is the count for this i and j pair.But this approach could be computationally intensive if we have to consider every possible i and j pair and compute the range of a for each. However, given the constraints (n up to 1000), perhaps this is feasible.So the plan would be:- Iterate over all possible pairs of i (odd) and j (even) where j &gt;= i.- For each pair, compute the possible a (number of &#39;(&#39; taken from the start block i) and d (number of &#39;)&#39; taken from the end block j), such that the sequence formed by taking a from i, all the blocks between i and j, and d from j forms a valid regular sequence.- For each such pair, compute the number of possible (a, d) pairs that satisfy all the constraints.- Sum all these counts.But how do we model the blocks between i and j?The key is that the blocks between i and j are all taken in full. So if i and j are not consecutive, then the blocks i+1 to j-1 are all taken in full. For example, if i is 1 and j is 4, then blocks 2 and 3 are taken in full. Block 2 is even, so all &#39;)&#39;, and block 3 is odd, all &#39;(&#39;, etc.So the sum of all full blocks between i and j must be considered. Let&#39;s model this.Let me define for a pair (i, j):- The start block i is an odd-numbered block (so &#39;(&#39;), and the end block j is even-numbered (so &#39;)&#39;).The substring is formed by:- a: number of &#39;(&#39; taken from the start of block i (1 &lt;= a &lt;= c_i).- all of the blocks i+1, i+2, ..., j-1.- d: number of &#39;)&#39; taken from the end of block j (1 &lt;= d &lt;= c_j).So the total &#39;(&#39; in the substring is a + sum of the counts of all odd-numbered blocks between i+1 and j-1.Similarly, the total &#39;)&#39; in the substring is sum of the counts of all even-numbered blocks between i+1 and j-1 plus d.Additionally, the balance during the traversal must never drop below zero.But how to model the balance transitions through the entire substring?Let&#39;s break down the substring into parts:1. The a &#39;(&#39; from block i.   Balance after this part: a.2. All blocks between i and j, processed in order.   For each block k between i+1 and j-1:   - if k is even (closing bracket), the entire block is &#39;)&#39;, so the balance decreases by c_k.   - if k is odd (opening bracket), the entire block is &#39;(&#39;, so the balance increases by c_k.   So after processing each block, the balance must remain &gt;=0.3. The d &#39;)&#39; from block j.   Each &#39;)&#39;, so the balance decreases by d.   But since the entire sequence must be balanced, the final balance is zero.So, the steps are:- The initial a &#39;(&#39; gives balance a.- Then, processing each block between i and j in order, the balance is modified by their counts. At any point, if the balance becomes negative, the sequence is invalid.- Finally, the d &#39;)&#39; must bring the balance down to zero. So the balance after processing the middle blocks (let&#39;s call it B) must satisfy B - d = 0 → d = B.But d is also between 1 and c_j.So, for the entire sequence to be valid:- The total number of &#39;(&#39; (a + sum of odd blocks between i+1 and j-1) must equal the total number of &#39;)&#39;.   The sum of &#39;)&#39; is sum of even blocks between i+1 and j-1 + d.   So:   a + sum_odds = sum_evens + d.   But d = B (the balance after processing the middle blocks) → B = a + sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle.Wait, perhaps we need to track the balance as we process the middle blocks.Wait, the balance after the a &#39;(&#39; is a.Then, processing each block between i+1 and j-1:For each block k:   if k is even (&#39;)&#39;), subtract c_k from balance.   if k is odd (&#39;(&#39;), add c_k to balance.After processing all these blocks, the balance is:balance_middle = a + sum_{k in odds} c_k - sum_{k in evens} c_k.Where the sums are over the blocks between i+1 and j-1.Then, the d &#39;)&#39; in block j must be equal to balance_middle, because after adding those, the total balance becomes balance_middle - d = 0.So d = balance_middle.But d must also be between 1 and c_j.So, for the pair (i,j) to form a valid sequence, the following conditions must hold:1. balance_middle = d.   So d must be equal to balance_middle.   Which implies that balance_middle &gt;=1 (since d &gt;=1) and &lt;=c_j.2. Also, during processing the middle blocks, the balance must never drop below zero at any step.So how to model this?This seems quite complex. Let&#39;s try to model this step by step.First, for a given pair (i,j):Compute the sum of the even and odd blocks between i+1 and j-1.Then, compute the balance after the middle blocks, which is a plus (sum_odds - sum_evens).This balance must be equal to d, which is between 1 and c_j.So:d = a + (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle).But d must be in [1, c_j].So substituting:1 &lt;= a + (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) &lt;= c_j.Also, a must be between 1 and c_i.Additionally, during processing the middle blocks, the balance must never drop below zero. Let&#39;s model that.When processing the middle blocks in order, starting with balance a, each step subtracts (if even) or adds (if odd) the block&#39;s count. At each step, balance must be &gt;=0.So, for example, suppose between i and j, the blocks are [k1, k2, k3], and their types are even, odd, even. Then, the balance after a is:a → subtract k1&#39;s c → a - c_k1 → check if &gt;=0.Then add k2&#39;s c → (a - c_k1) + c_k2 → check if &gt;=0.Then subtract k3&#39;s c → (a - c_k1 + c_k2) - c_k3 → check if &gt;=0.At each step, the balance must not drop below zero.This seems very challenging to model. Because for each possible i and j, we need to track the possible a values that allow the balance to stay non-negative through all steps.But given that n is up to 1000, and i and j can be up to 1000, this may not be feasible unless we find a way to model these constraints efficiently.Alternative approach: precompute for each possible (i,j) pair the sum of the even and odd blocks between them, and the possible a and d values.But the critical part is ensuring that during processing the middle blocks, the balance remains non-negative.Hmm. Let&#39;s think of an example where the middle blocks could cause the balance to dip below zero.Suppose i=1 (c_1=10), j=4 (c_4=5). The blocks between i and j are 2 (even, c_2=20) and 3 (odd, c_3=15).So the middle blocks are 2 and 3.Processing block 2: after a, balance is a - 20. For this to be &gt;=0, a &gt;=20.Then, processing block 3: balance becomes (a -20) +15 = a -5. This must be &gt;=0 → a &gt;=5.But a must be &gt;=20 (from the first step). So overall, a &gt;=20.Then, balance_middle is a-5.d must be equal to a-5, and between 1 and 5.So:1 &lt;= a-5 &lt;=5 → 6 &lt;=a &lt;=10.But a must be &gt;=20 (from the first condition), which contradicts. So in this case, there&#39;s no possible a and d.Thus, the pair (i=1, j=4) contributes 0.So even though the sum of a and the middle blocks&#39; odds and evens may allow d to be in the correct range, if during processing the middle blocks the balance drops below zero, the sequence is invalid.Thus, the main challenge is to compute for a given pair (i,j) the possible a values that satisfy:1. a is in [1, c_i]2. d = a + (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) is in [1, c_j]3. during processing the middle blocks, the balance never drops below zero.But how to model this for all possible i and j pairs?This seems quite complex, but perhaps we can find a way to precompute the necessary information for each possible (i,j) pair.Let&#39;s outline the steps needed for each (i,j) pair:1. Check if i is odd and j is even, and i &lt;=j.   If not, skip.2. Compute sum_odds_middle and sum_evens_middle for blocks between i+1 and j-1.   sum_odds_middle is the sum of c_k where k is odd and i+1 &lt;=k &lt;=j-1.   sum_evens_middle is the sum of c_k where k is even and i+1 &lt;=k &lt;=j-1.3. Compute the required d = a + (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle).   d must be &gt;=1 and &lt;=c_j.4. Also, a must be between 1 and c_i.5. So combining, a must be in the intersection of:   a &gt;= max(1, 1 - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) +1) → since d &gt;=1 → a &gt;= 1 - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) ?   Wait, no. d = a + (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) &gt;=1 → a &gt;= 1 - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle).   Also, d &lt;=c_j → a &lt;= c_j - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle).   So a must be in the range:   max(1, 1 - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle)) ) &lt;= a &lt;= min(c_i, c_j - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) )   But if the lower bound is larger than the upper bound, there&#39;s no solution.6. But even if a is in this range, the processing of the middle blocks must not cause the balance to drop below zero.   So for each (i,j), we need to model the possible a that, when processing the middle blocks, the balance after each step is &gt;=0.But how?This seems like the hardest part.An alternative approach is to precompute for each (i,j) pair the minimal required a that ensures that during processing the middle blocks, the balance never drops below zero.Then, the valid a&#39;s are those that are &gt;= this minimal a and also satisfy the previous constraints.But how to compute this minimal a?Let&#39;s think about processing the middle blocks between i and j. Let&#39;s model the process of processing each block and track the minimal a required to prevent the balance from dropping below zero.Let&#39;s consider the blocks between i+1 and j-1 as a list.For example, the blocks are ordered as k1, k2, ..., km.Each block is either even (&#39;)&#39;) or odd (&#39;(&#39;).The processing starts with balance a, then after each block, the balance is updated as:if even: balance -= c_k.if odd: balance += c_k.At each step, balance must &gt;=0.We need to find the minimal a such that, after processing all these blocks in order, the balance after each step is &gt;=0.Let me model this as a series of constraints on a.Let&#39;s denote the sequence of blocks as B_1, B_2, ..., B_m.For each block B_t, which is either even or odd, we can compute the cumulative effect on the balance.Let&#39;s track the cumulative delta for each step.Let&#39;s define delta_0 = 0.For each step t from 1 to m:delta_t = delta_{t-1} + (c_{B_t} if B_t is odd else -c_{B_t}).Then, after processing block B_t, the balance is a + delta_t.Wait, no. Because the balance starts at a, and after each block, it changes by (c if odd, -c if even).Wait, for block B_1:balance after processing B_1 is a + (if B_1 is odd: +c_{B_1} else -c_{B_1}).For block B_2, balance is that result plus (c_{B_2} if odd else -c_{B_2}).So overall, after processing B_1 to B_m, the balance is a + sum_{t=1 to m} (if B_t is odd: +c_{B_t} else -c_{B_t}).But during processing each B_t, the balance after processing B_1 to B_t must be &gt;=0.So for each t in 1..m:a + sum_{s=1 to t} (if B_s is odd: +c_s else -c_s) &gt;= 0.Let&#39;s denote the sum from s=1 to t as S_t.Then, the constraints are:a + S_1 &gt;= 0a + S_2 &gt;= 0...a + S_m &gt;= 0Additionally, we have the constraints from the previous steps (d must be in [1, c_j], etc.)So the minimal a required is a &gt;= max( -S_1, -S_2, ..., -S_m, 1 - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) ), and a &lt;= min( c_i, c_j - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) )But this approach would require for each (i,j) pair to compute all the partial sums S_t and find the minimal a required.For example, let&#39;s take the blocks between i+1 and j-1 as B_1 to B_m.Compute S_1, S_2, ..., S_m.Then the constraints for a are:a &gt;= max( -S_1, -S_2, ..., -S_m )Because a + S_t &gt;=0 → a &gt;= -S_t for all t.So the minimal a required is the maximum of all -S_t.But S_t is the cumulative sum up to t.So, for each (i,j) pair, we need to compute all S_t and find the maximum of (-S_t) across all t.Then, a must be &gt;= this value.Now, the a must also satisfy the other constraints (a &gt;= 1 - (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) ?)Wait, no. The other constraints are:d = a + (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle) must be &gt;=1 and &lt;= c_j.sum_odds_middle is the sum of the c_k for odd k in i+1..j-1.sum_evens_middle is the sum of c_k for even k in i+1..j-1.sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle is equal to the sum of (c_k if k is odd else -c_k) for k in i+1..j-1.Which is exactly the sum that is S_m, where m is the total number of middle blocks.So sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle = S_m.Because for each middle block, if it&#39;s odd, add c_k, else subtract c_k.So sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle is S_m.So d = a + S_m.So the constraints on a are:d &gt;=1 → a &gt;= 1 - S_m.d &lt;= c_j → a &lt;= c_j - S_m.Additionally, a &gt;= max( -S_1, -S_2, ..., -S_m )a &gt;= 1 (since a must be at least 1, as we take at least one &#39;(&#39; from block i).So combining all constraints:a &gt;= max( 1, 1 - S_m, -S_1, -S_2, ..., -S_m )a &lt;= min( c_i, c_j - S_m )The valid range for a is [a_min, a_max], where:a_min = max(1, 1 - S_m, max_neg_S )where max_neg_S is the maximum of (-S_t) for t in 1..m.a_max = min(c_i, c_j - S_m )If a_min &gt; a_max, then there are no valid a for this (i,j) pair.Otherwise, the count is a_max - a_min + 1.But how to compute S_1 to S_m and the max_neg_S for each (i,j) pair.This seems manageable.So the steps for each (i,j) pair where i is odd and j is even, i &lt;=j:1. Check if i and j are valid (i odd, j even, i &lt;=j). If not, skip.2. Collect the middle blocks: blocks i+1 to j-1.3. For these middle blocks, compute the sequence of S_t (the cumulative sum of (c_k if odd else -c_k) up to each block t).4. Compute sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle, which is S_m (sum of all the contributions from the middle blocks).5. Compute d = a + S_m. So d must be in [1, c_j].6. Compute the constraints for a:   a &gt;= max(1, 1 - S_m, max(-S_1, -S_2, ..., -S_m) )   a &lt;= min(c_i, c_j - S_m )7. If a_min &gt; a_max, no contribution. Otherwise, the number of valid a is a_max - a_min + 1.8. Add this count to the total.So the plan is to iterate over all possible (i,j) pairs, compute the above for each, and sum the counts.Now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.But how?Given that n is up to 1000, the number of (i,j) pairs is O(n^2) → 1e6 pairs. For each pair, processing the middle blocks (up to 1000 steps) would take O(n) time. So total time would be O(n^3), which is 1e9 operations. That&#39;s way too slow.Wait, but n is up to 1000, so 1e3 cubed is 1e9, which is too much for Python. That would not pass the time constraints.So this approach is not feasible. Need a better way.So we need a way to compute the required a ranges for each (i,j) pair in O(1) or O(m) time, where m is the number of middle blocks. But m can be up to 1000.But 1e6 * 1e3 = 1e9 operations, which is not feasible.Alternative approach: precompute for all possible intervals [i,j] the required information.Wait, but even that would be O(n^3), which is not feasible.Hmm.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a way to precompute for each possible i and j the required information quickly.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the entire sequence of blocks and track possible valid starts and ends.Let me think again about the possible regular sequences. They can be:- A single pair of consecutive blocks: i (odd) and j=i+1 (even). So, taking some &#39;(&#39; from i and some &#39;)&#39;, and the count is min(c_i, c_j).But this is only the case when there are no middle blocks. But when there are middle blocks, the problem becomes more complex.So perhaps the majority of valid sequences are formed from pairs of i and j that are consecutive.But the sample inputs show that there are sequences with more than two blocks. For example, the third example input is [1,1,1,1,2,2], which gives the original sequence as &#39;()()(())&#39;. The valid subsegments include the entire string, which is 8 characters. So the entire string is a regular sequence. That would involve i=1, j=6 (even) and the middle blocks are 2,3,4,5.So the code needs to handle such cases.So to handle all possible cases, the previous approach of checking all (i,j) pairs is necessary, but the O(n^3) time is prohibitive.Hmm. Let&#39;s think of possible optimizations.One possible optimization is that for certain pairs (i,j), the middle blocks can make the sum S_m very large or very small, leading to d being out of range. Also, during processing the middle blocks, the required a may be too large (exceeding c_i), leading to no possible solutions.But how to find this quickly.Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the middle blocks&#39; contributions (S_m) can be precomputed for all possible (i,j) pairs. But even that would take O(n^2) time.Another observation: the sum S_m is the sum of (c_k if k is odd else -c_k) for all middle blocks k.But in the case where i and j are consecutive, there are no middle blocks. So S_m is zero. So for consecutive pairs (i, j), the sum S_m is zero.Thus, d = a + 0 → d =a. So d must be between 1 and c_j, and a between 1 and c_i. Also, since there are no middle blocks, the processing steps are just a and d. So the constraints are a &gt;= max(1, ...) (since no middle blocks, the steps processing has no constraints except a &gt;=0 and d &gt;=0). But since there are no middle blocks, the balance after processing a is a, then we process d. But since the entire sequence is a &#39;(&#39; followed by d &#39;)&#39;, the balance after a is a, then subtract d. So the entire sequence is balanced (a =d), and the balance after the a is a, which is positive. Then after subtracting d (a), balance is zero. So the only constraint is a =d, a &lt;= min(c_i, c_j), and a &gt;=1.Thus, the count is min(c_i, c_j). Which is the case for consecutive pairs. So for consecutive pairs, the count is min(c_i, c_j). So this explains the first sample input, which has pairs like i=3, j=4 (consecutive), leading to a count of min(1,3) =1. But the sample&#39;s first example&#39;s output is 5, which includes such cases.But how to handle non-consecutive pairs quickly.Alternative idea: for non-consecutive pairs, the required a may be very large, which is impossible given the c_i and c_j.For example, in the case where sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle is a large negative number. Then d =a + S_m would be small, but a must be &gt;= ... (other constraints). So perhaps for most pairs, the valid a range is empty, and thus contributes nothing. So we need a way to efficiently compute for each pair (i,j) whether there&#39;s a possible a in the valid range, and if so, compute the count.But again, the O(n^3) time is a problem.Alternative approach: consider the problem as a stack-based approach similar to the standard valid parentheses problem.In the standard problem, we use a stack to track the indices of the unmatched &#39;(&#39;, and for each &#39;)&#39;, we pop the stack and calculate the length between the current index and the popped index.But again, given the compressed form, this approach would need to be modified.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming, tracking the possible balance and positions.But the balance can be up to 1e9, which makes this approach infeasible.Hmm. Let&#39;s think of another way.The key insight for regular sequences is that they must be balanced and have non-negative balance at every step.But given the compressed form, any valid regular sequence must be a substring that starts with some &#39;(&#39;, ends with some &#39;)&#39;, and in between, there&#39;s a series of full blocks and partial blocks.So perhaps the valid sequences can be categorized into two types:1. Those that consist of a single pair of partial blocks (i and j being consecutive).2. Those that involve multiple blocks.But handling the second type requires considering the balance through the middle blocks.Another observation: for a pair (i,j) with j &gt; i+1, the middle blocks must form a valid sequence themselves when combined with the a and d. But how?Alternatively, perhaps the minimal a required is the maximum of the required a from the middle blocks processing steps.So, for each pair (i,j), the minimal a is determined by the steps in processing the middle blocks. For example, if during processing the middle blocks, the balance after some step is S_t, then a must be &gt;= -S_t.So the minimal a is the maximum of all -S_t for all t in the middle blocks.Thus, for each pair (i,j), we need to compute all the partial sums S_t of the middle blocks and track the maximum of (-S_t).But how to compute this efficiently.If we can precompute for all possible intervals [i,j] the maximum of (-S_t) and the sum S_m (sum of all middle blocks), then we can compute the a_min and a_max quickly.But how to precompute this.Alternatively, for each possible i (odd), we can iterate j from i+1 (even) up to n (even), and for each j, compute the required parameters as we go.For example, when j increases by 2 (since j must be even), we can add the next two blocks (even and odd) to the middle blocks and update the partial sums.But this may not be straightforward.Let me consider how the processing of middle blocks works as j increases.For example, starting with i=1 (odd), j=2 (even). Middle blocks are none.Then j=4: middle blocks are 2 (even) and 3 (odd).Then j=6: middle blocks are 2,3,4 (even), 5 (odd).So for i=1, j increases by 2 each time.For each j, the middle blocks are i+1 to j-1.So for a fixed i, we can iterate j from i+1 (if even) or i+2 (if even), and accumulate the middle blocks as j increases.For each i, we can track the cumulative sum S and the maximum of (-S_t) as we add each middle block.For example, for i=1, j=2: no middle blocks. S=0. max_neg_S = 0 (since there are no steps, but since there are no steps, the minimal a is 1 - S_m=1-0=1, but in this case, the processing steps are empty, so the constraints are a &gt;= max(1, 1 - S_m, ...). But when there are no steps, the max_neg_S is 0.So a_min = max(1, 1 - S_m, 0) = max(1, 1 -0, 0) = 1.a_max = min(c_i, c_j - S_m) = min(c_1, c_j - 0) = min(c_1, c_j).d = a + S_m = a +0 = a.d must be between 1 and c_j.So for j=2, a_min=1, a_max=min(c_1, c_j). So the count is max(0, a_max - a_min +1) if a_max &gt;=a_min.But this is exactly the case for consecutive pairs, which contributes min(c_i, c_j) if c_i &gt;=1 and c_j &gt;=1.Thus, for consecutive pairs, this approach works.But for non-consecutive pairs, we need to accumulate the middle blocks and track the required parameters.So, for a fixed i (odd), iterate j from i+1 (even) or i+2 (even) up to n (even), and for each j, track the cumulative sum S (sum of middle blocks&#39; contributions) and the max_neg_S (the maximum of -S_t for all steps).This can be done incrementally.For example:i=1 (odd).j=2 (even): no middle blocks.sum_odds_middle = 0sum_evens_middle =0S_m = sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle =0.max_neg_S = 0 (since no steps).j=4 (even): middle blocks are 2 (even), 3 (odd).Processing block 2 (even):delta_1 = -c_2.S_t for t=1 is -c_2.max_neg_S = max(0, c_2) → no, max_neg_S is the maximum of (-S_t) for all t. So -S_t is c_2.Then processing block 3 (odd):delta_2 = -c_2 + c_3.S_t for t=2 is delta_2.So the S_t values are -c_2 and (-c_2 +c_3).The maximum of (-S_t) for t=1 and t=2 is:max(c_2, c_2 - c_3).So max_neg_S = max(c_2, c_2 - c_3).But this depends on c_3.Then for j=4:sum_odds_middle = c_3sum_evens_middle = c_2.S_m = c_3 - c_2.Thus, d = a + (c_3 -c_2).Constraints:a &gt;= max(1, 1 - (c_3 -c_2), max_neg_S )a &lt;= min(c_i, c_j - (c_3 -c_2) )So for each j, when we add a new block, we can update the cumulative sum and the max_neg_S.Thus, for a fixed i, we can process j in steps, adding blocks incrementally and tracking the necessary parameters.This way, for each i, we can process j from i+1 to n, even or odd, and accumulate the required information.But how to manage this.For each i (odd):   current_sum = 0 (sum of contributions from middle blocks)   current_max_neg_S = 0 (the maximum of (-S_t) for all steps so far)   steps = [] (the list of delta steps)   for j in i+1 to n:      if j is even:          // process blocks between i+1 and j-1          // but j increments by 1 each time, so for j to be even, when we increment j, we need to process all blocks up to j-1.          // perhaps this approach is not correct.          // alternative: for j to be even, and i is odd, the middle blocks are i+1 to j-1.          // So when j increases by 1, we add block j-1 to the middle blocks.          // But j must be even.          // So for example, i=1 (odd), j=2 (even):              middle blocks: 1+1 to 2-1 → 2 to 1 → none.              j increases to 4 (even):              middle blocks: 2 to 3.          // So for j to be even, the step from j-2 (even) to j (even) adds two blocks.          // So perhaps for j even, the middle blocks are those between i+1 and j-1.          // So for i=1 (odd), j=4 (even):              middle blocks are 2 (even) and 3 (odd).          // So for a fixed i, j can be even and &gt;=i+1.          // For each j even, the middle blocks are i+1 to j-1.          // So when j increases by 2, the middle blocks increase by 2.          // So for i=1, j=2: middle blocks are 1+1 to 2-1 → 2 to 1 → none.          // j=4: middle blocks are 2 and 3.          // j=6: middle blocks are 2,3,4,5.          // So for each even j, the middle blocks are i+1 to j-1, which may be even or odd.          // So the processing of middle blocks between i+1 and j-1 can be done by considering j increases by 2 steps.          // But this may not be efficient.          // Alternative approach: for a fixed i, iterate j from i+1 (even) to n, and for each j, iterate through the blocks between i+1 and j-1.          // But this is O(n^2) for all i and j pairs.          // So for each i (O(n)), and j up to O(n), and middle blocks up to O(n), leading to O(n^3) time.          // Which is not feasible.So this seems like a dead end.Alternative Idea:The valid regular sequences must be balanced, which implies that the total number of &#39;(&#39; equals the total number of &#39;)&#39;. In terms of the compressed blocks:The sum of the a (from start block i) plus the sum of all odd middle blocks equals the sum of all even middle blocks plus d (from end block j).But given the constraints of processing the middle blocks, this is not sufficient.But perhaps, for non-consecutive pairs (i,j), the sum of the middle blocks&#39; odds and evens must be such that sum_odds_middle &gt;= sum_evens_middle. Otherwise, the required a would have to be larger than c_i, which is not possible.For example, if sum_odds_middle &lt; sum_evens_middle, then S_m is negative. So d =a + S_m. To have d &gt;=1, a &gt;= 1 - S_m. But S_m is negative → 1 - S_m is 1 + |S_m|. So a needs to be at least 1 + |S_m|. But if 1 + |S_m| exceeds c_i, then no solution exists.But sum_odds_middle can be anything. So this is just one factor.But again, without knowing the sum, it&#39;s hard to generalize.Alternative Idea:Let&#39;s consider that the valid regular sequences must be such that the sum_odds_middle &gt;= sum_evens_middle. Otherwise, the required a is too large.But this is not necessarily true, because the sum_odds_middle could be less than sum_evens_middle, but the processing of the middle blocks could require a certain a that&#39;s manageable.But this is not a general rule.At this point, I&#39;m stuck. I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.Perhaps I should look for hints in the sample inputs.Looking at the third sample input:61 1 1 1 2 2The output is 7.The original sequence is:Block 1: 1 &#39;(&#39; → &#39;(&#39;Block 2: 1 &#39;)&#39; → &#39;)&#39;Block 3: 1 &#39;(&#39; → &#39;(&#39;Block 4: 1 &#39;)&#39; → &#39;)&#39;Block 5: 2 &#39;(&#39; → &#39;(( &#39;Block 6: 2 &#39;)&#39; → &#39;))&#39;So the full sequence is ()()(()).The valid subsegments are:1. The first two characters &quot;()&quot; (from block 1 and 2).2. The first four characters &quot;()()&quot; (blocks 1-4).3. The third and fourth characters &quot;()&quot; (blocks 3-4).4. The fifth to eighth characters &quot;(())&quot; (blocks 5-6).5. The fifth to sixth characters &quot;((&quot; → no. Wait, no. Wait, the fifth block is 2 &#39;(&#39;, sixth is 2 &#39;)&#39;.So the entire sequence is:()()(())So the valid subsegments are:- Each of the individual pairs from consecutive blocks: block 1-2 (count 1), block3-4 (count 1), block5-6 (count 2). Wait, min(1,1) is 1 for the first two pairs. For block5-6, min(2,2) is 2.So that&#39;s 1+1+2=4.Then the entire string is ()()(()), which is a valid regular sequence. So it starts in block 1, ends in block6. Let&#39;s compute the a and d.Middle blocks are 2,3,4,5.Sum_odds_middle = block3 (1) and block5 (2) → sum 3.Sum_evens_middle = block2 (1) and block4 (1) → sum 2.S_m = 3-2=1.d =a +1.d must be &lt;= c_j=2.So a &lt;= 2-1=1.Also, a &gt;= max(1, 1 -1=0, max_neg_S).But what is max_neg_S?Processing the middle blocks:Blocks 2 (even, 1), 3 (odd, 1), 4 (even, 1), 5 (odd, 2).The steps:Block 2: delta is -1 → S_1 =-1. balance after this step is a-1 &gt;=0 → a &gt;=1.Block3: delta is +1 → S_2 =0. balance is a-1 +1 =a &gt;=0. So no new constraint (since a &gt;=1).Block4: delta is -1 → S_3 =-1. balance is a-1 +1 -1 = a-1 &gt;=0 → a &gt;=1.Block5: delta is +2 → S_4 =1. balance is a-1 +1 -1 +2 = a+1 &gt;=0 → a &gt;=-1. But since a &gt;=1 from previous steps, no new constraint.So max_neg_S is max(1, 1, ...) → a &gt;=1.So a_min is max(1, 1-1=0, 1) → 1.a_max is min(1, 2-1=1) →1.So a=1, d=2.So the sequence is a=1 &#39;(&#39; from block1, all of blocks 2-5, and d=2 &#39;)&#39; from block6. The total is 1 &#39;(&#39; + 1 &#39;)&#39; (block2) + 1 &#39;(&#39; (block3) + 1 &#39;)&#39; (block4) + 2 &#39;(&#39; (block5) + 2 &#39;)&#39; → &quot;())()((()))&quot; → wait, no. Let me recheck.Original blocks:Block1: 1 &#39;(&#39; → &#39;(&#39;,Block2: 1 &#39;)&#39;,Block3: 1 &#39;(&#39;,Block4: 1 &#39;)&#39;,Block5: 2 &#39;(&#39;,Block6: 2 &#39;)&#39;.So the entire string is &#39;()()(()))&#39;? Or &#39;()()(( ))&#39;.Wait, the entire string is constructed as:1 &#39;(&#39;, 1 &#39;)&#39;, 1 &#39;(&#39;, 1 &#39;)&#39;, 2 &#39;(&#39;, 2 &#39;)&#39;, which gives &#39;()()(()))&#39;? Or &#39;()()(())&#39;, which is length 8.So the entire sequence is a valid regular sequence. This corresponds to a=1, d=2, which is valid.So this contributes 1 to the count.Other valid sequences in this sample:There&#39;s also the combination of blocks 3-4 (another ()), and the combination of blocks 5-6 (two possibilities: 1 or 2 pairs).Additionally, the substring starting at block3 and ending at block6:Middle blocks are 4 (even, 1), 5 (odd, 2).S_m is (2) - (1) =1.d= a+1.a must be &gt;= max(1, 1-1=0, ...).Processing middle blocks:Block4: even, 1. delta is -1. S_1 =-1 → a &gt;=1.Block5: odd, 2. delta is +2. S_2 =1 → a+1 &gt;=0 → a &gt;=-1. But a &gt;=1 from previous.So a_min = max(1, 0, 1) →1.a_max = min(1 (c_3=1), 2-1=1 → 1.So a=1, d=2.So the substring is block3&#39;s 1 &#39;(&#39;, all of block4 (1 &#39;)&#39;), all of block5 (2 &#39;(&#39;, then 2 &#39;)&#39;. So the sequence is &#39;(())&#39;, which is valid.So this contributes 1.The other valid sequences are perhaps the combination of block5-6 (min(2,2) → 2), but wait the sample output is 7.So the total count is 7.But according to the previous approach:The consecutive pairs contribute:block1-2: 1.block3-4:1.block5-6:2.The entire string (i=1,j=6):1.i=3,j=6:1.i=5,j=6:2.Other sequences:i=3,j=4:1.i=5,j=6:2.So that&#39;s 1+1+2+1+1+1+1=8. Wait, but the sample output is 7. Hmm, maybe my manual calculation is wrong.Anyway, the key is that the code must account for all possible valid pairs (i,j).But the problem is to find a way to compute the required parameters for each (i,j) pair efficiently.Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial plan and implement it as efficiently as possible, even if it&#39;s O(n^3), but optimize where possible.But for n=1e3, O(n^3) is 1e9 operations, which is way too slow for Python.So perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way.Another Idea:A regular bracket sequence must be of even length. Each &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39; contributes to the balance.But given the compressed form, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:For a substring to be regular, it must start with a &#39;(&#39; and end with &#39;)&#39;, and the total number of &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39; must be equal.But also, during the traversal, the balance must not drop below zero.Thus, the problem can be split into two parts:1. Find all possible substrings that are balanced.2. Among these, count those where the balance never drops below zero.But again, the challenge is to model this in terms of the compressed blocks.Another Idea:The valid regular sequences must form a structure where each opening bracket is properly closed. For example, the first &#39;(&#39; must be closed by the last &#39;)&#39;, and so on. Thus, the sequence must be a valid VPS (valid parentheses structure) which can be decomposed into a hierarchy of pairs.But how to model this for compressed blocks.An alternative approach inspired by the standard VPS problem:We can use a stack to keep track of possible starting positions. For each new closing bracket, we pop the stack and compute the valid pairs.But in the compressed form, each block represents a run of &#39;(&#39; or &#39;)&#39;. So, perhaps we can model the stack in terms of the blocks.For example, each time we encounter an opening block (i is odd), we push it onto the stack. For each closing block (i even), we try to match it with the previous opening block.But this requires handling the counts of the blocks.But this approach is not directly applicable. For example, when a closing block has more brackets than the top opening block, we can form a valid pair for the minimum of the two, and then the remainder of the closing block can be used to match with previous opening blocks.This is similar to the approach used in the problem of counting valid parentheses in a compressed format.This approach might work.Let me think of how this could be implemented.For example, consider the standard stack approach for VPS:We maintain a stack that keeps track of the indices of the opening brackets. For each closing bracket, if there&#39;s a matching opening bracket in the stack, we pop it and compute the length of the valid sequence.But in the compressed case, each block is a run of brackets. So we can model the stack as a list of tuples representing the accumulated possible opening brackets.For example, for an opening block i (odd) with count c_i, we can push onto the stack a tuple (i, available_opening). Each time a closing block j (even) is processed, we try to match as many closing brackets as possible with the available openings.But how to model this.Let&#39;s consider processing the blocks in order.We can maintain a stack where each element is a tuple (index, available_opening, cumulative_balance).For example:When processing an opening block i (odd), we push (i, c_i, c_i) onto the stack. The available_opening is the number of &#39;(&#39; that can be used to form valid pairs with closing brackets, and the cumulative_balance is the total number of &#39;(&#39; up to this block.Then, when processing a closing block j (even), we need to match as many &#39;)&#39; as possible with the available openings in the stack.For each &#39;)&#39;, we can take as many as possible from the top element of the stack.For example, the top of the stack has available_opening = a, cumulative_balance = b.The current closing block has count d = c_j.The number of possible pairs is min(a, d).But this is not correct, because the cumulative balance after using these pairs must not drop below zero.Wait, perhaps this approach can be adapted.Alternatively, here&#39;s an approach inspired by the solution for the standard valid parentheses problem, but adapted to the compressed blocks.We can model the stack as a list of (max_available, required_opening).For each opening block i (odd), we push (c_i, 0) onto the stack.For each closing block j (even), we calculate how many valid pairs can be formed with previous opening blocks.The number of valid pairs is limited by the current closing block&#39;s count and the available opening brackets in the stack.But we also need to account for possible existing required openings from previous layers.This seems complex, but let&#39;s think of it step by step.When processing a closing block j (even):- The count is c_j.- We iterate while the stack is not empty and c_j &gt;0:   Take the top element from the stack.   The available_opening is the available brackets in this element.   The pairs formed is min(available_opening, c_j).   The number of valid sequences is pairs.   We then subtract pairs from available_opening and c_j.   If available_opening becomes zero, pop the element from the stack.   Add the pairs to the total.But this doesn&#39;t account for the required balance during the sequence.For example, if between the opening and closing blocks there are other blocks, the balance might have dropped below zero.Thus, this approach is not sufficient.Thus, this line of thinking may not work.Thus, back to the original approach.Perhaps the only way to proceed is to implement the initial approach, and then optimize where possible.But for n=1000, O(n^3) is not feasible. So what&#39;s the alternative?Alternative Idea:For a pair (i,j), the required a_min is the maximum of:- 1,- 1 - S_m,- the maximum of (-S_t) for all t in middle steps.But S_m is the sum of all contributions from the middle blocks (sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle).S_t is the sum up to step t.Thus, the maximum of (-S_t) is the maximum of the negative cumulative sums.But how to compute this.If we can compute for each pair (i,j) the maximum of (-S_t) and S_m, then the a_min and a_max can be computed.But how to compute these efficiently.We can precompute for each interval [i+1, j-1] the sum S_m and the maximum of (-S_t).This can be done with a prefix sum array.But for each interval, the computation of S_m and the maximum of (-S_t) can be done in O(1) time if we precompute prefix sums and the maximums.But this seems possible.For example:Let&#39;s precompute a prefix array for each block k, where each entry stores the contribution of the block (c_k if k is odd, -c_k if even).Then, the sum S_m for the interval [i+1, j-1] is the sum of the contributions of the blocks from i+1 to j-1.The maximum of (-S_t) for t in [i+1, j-1] can be computed using a prefix sum array and a range maximum query structure.For example, the prefix sum array can be built, and for each position t, we track the sum up to t. Then, for a given interval [a, b], the prefix sums can be used to compute the cumulative sums for each step.The maximum of (-S_t) for t in [a, b] is the maximum of (-(prefix_sum[t] - prefix_sum[a-1])) for t in [a, b].This is equivalent to the maximum of (prefix_sum[a-1] - prefix_sum[t]).So for each interval [a,b], the maximum of (prefix_sum[a-1] - prefix_sum[t]) for t in [a,b].This can be computed using a range minimum query on the prefix_sum array.Because:max (prefix_sum[a-1] - prefix_sum[t]) = prefix_sum[a-1] - min (prefix_sum[t] for t in [a,b]).Thus, for each interval [a,b], the maximum of (-S_t) is prefix_sum[a-1] - min(prefix_sum[a..b]).This allows us to compute the maximum of (-S_t) for any interval in O(1) time if we have a precomputed range minimum query (RMQ) data structure for the prefix sum array.Similarly, the sum S_m for the interval [a,b] is the sum of contributions, which can be computed as prefix_sum[b] - prefix_sum[a-1].Thus, if we precompute the prefix sums and build an RMQ structure, we can compute for any interval [i+1, j-1]:sum_odds_middle - sum_evens_middle = S_m = prefix_sum[j-1] - prefix_sum[i]max_neg_S = prefix_sum[i] - RMQ_min(i+1, j-1)This is a crucial insight.Thus, the steps for each pair (i,j) are:1. i must be odd, j even, i &lt;=j.2. Middle blocks are [i+1, j-1].3. Compute S_m = prefix_sum[j-1] - prefix_sum[i].4. Compute min_prefix = RMQ_min(i+1, j-1).5. max_neg_S = prefix_sum[i] - min_prefix.6. a_min = max(1, 1 - S_m, max_neg_S)7. a_max = min(c_i, c_j - S_m)8. If a_min &gt; a_max: continue.9. Else: add (a_max - a_min + 1) to the total.But how to handle cases where there are no middle blocks (i+1 &gt;j-1).For example, when j =i+1:middle blocks are [i+1, j-1] → [i+1, i+1-1] → empty.In this case:S_m =0.max_neg_S = 0 (since there are no steps).So a_min = max(1, 1-0=1, 0) → 1.a_max = min(c_i, c_j -0) → min(c_i, c_j).Thus, the count is min(c_i, c_j), which matches the case for consecutive pairs.Thus, this approach works for all cases.Thus, the steps to implement are:- Precompute the prefix sum array of the contributions (c_k if k is odd, -c_k if even).- Precompute an RMQ structure to find the minimum prefix sum in a range.- Iterate all pairs (i,j) where i is odd, j is even, i &lt;=j.- For each pair:   a. Compute the middle blocks as i+1 to j-1.   b. If i+1 &gt;j-1: middle blocks are empty. S_m=0. max_neg_S=0.   c. Else:      compute S_m = prefix_sum[j-1] - prefix_sum[i].      compute min_prefix = RMQ.query_min(i+1, j-1).      max_neg_S = prefix_sum[i] - min_prefix.   d. Compute a_min = max(1, 1 - S_m, max_neg_S).   e. Compute a_max = min(c[i], c[j] - S_m).   f. If a_min &gt; a_max: continue.   g. Else: add (a_max - a_min + 1) to the total.This approach reduces the computation for each (i,j) pair to O(1) time, provided that the RMQ structure allows O(1) queries.The prefix sum array can be computed in O(n) time.The RMQ structure can be built in O(n log n) time using a sparse table, which allows O(1) query time.Thus, the overall time complexity becomes O(n^2), which is feasible for n=1000.Thus, this approach is viable.Now, let&#39;s implement this.First, we need to precompute the prefix sum array.For each block k (from 1 to n), compute the contribution as:contrib = c[k-1] if k is odd else -c[k-1]Then, prefix_sum[0] =0.prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + contrib[i-1], where contrib[i-1] is the contribution of the i-th block.Wait, perhaps indexing is 1-based.But in code, we&#39;ll have to manage it as 0-based or 1-based.Let&#39;s say the blocks are 1-based.For example, block 1 is first, block 2 is second.prefix_sum[0] =0.prefix_sum[1] = contrib of block 1.prefix_sum[2] = prefix_sum[1] + contrib of block 2....prefix_sum[k] = sum of contrib of blocks 1 to k.Then, the contribution of blocks a to b is prefix_sum[b] - prefix_sum[a-1].Thus, for blocks i+1 to j-1, the contribution is prefix_sum[j-1-1] - prefix_sum[i+1-1-1] ?No, perhaps I should re-express.Wait, the blocks between i+1 and j-1 are the blocks with indices from (i+1) to (j-1), inclusive.The prefix_sum for the blocks up to (j-1) is prefix_sum[j-1], and up to i is prefix_sum[i].So the sum of blocks from i+1 to j-1 is prefix_sum[j-1] - prefix_sum[i].Yes.Thus, the code would:contrib = [0]*(n+1)  # 1-based.prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)for k in range(1, n+1):    if k %2 ==1:        contrib[k] = c[k-1]    else:        contrib[k] = -c[k-1]    prefix_sum[k] = prefix_sum[k-1] + contrib[k]Then, the sum of blocks from a to b (inclusive) is prefix_sum[b] - prefix_sum[a-1].Thus, for blocks i+1 to j-1:if i+1 &gt; j-1: sum is 0.else: sum is prefix_sum[j-1] - prefix_sum[i].Then, the RMQ structure is built on the prefix_sum array, and for a range [a, b], the minimum in that range is found.Thus, the max_neg_S is prefix_sum[i] - min(prefix_sum[a..b]).Where a =i+1, b =j-1.Thus, the code needs to compute this.Thus, the steps are:Implement a sparse table for range minimum queries.Once the prefix_sum array is computed and the sparse table is built, then for each pair (i,j):if j &lt;=i:   continue.if i is even or j is odd:   continue.middle_start =i+1middle_end =j-1if middle_start &gt; middle_end:   S_m =0   max_neg_S =0else:   S_m = prefix_sum[middle_end] - prefix_sum[i]   min_prefix = get_range_min(middle_start, middle_end)   max_neg_S = prefix_sum[i] - min_prefixa_min = max(1, 1 - S_m, max_neg_S)a_max = min(c[i-1], c[j-1] - S_m)if a_min &gt; a_max:   continueelse:   total += a_max - a_min +1Wait, but the c array is 0-based in code.Yes.Thus, this approach should work.Now, the code.First, read the input.n = int(input())c = list(map(int, input().split()))Then, compute the prefix_sum array.contrib = [0]*(n+1)  # 1-based index.for k in range(1, n+1):    if k %2 ==1:        contrib[k] = c[k-1]    else:        contrib[k] = -c[k-1]prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)for k in range(1, n+1):    prefix_sum[k] = prefix_sum[k-1] + contrib[k]Then, build a sparse table for range minimum queries on the prefix_sum array.The sparse table can be built with log2(n) layers.But for Python, a simple implementation using a list of lists would suffice.But with n up to 1000, the log2(n) is about 10.The code for building the sparse table:import mathlog_table = [0]*(n+1)for i in range(2, n+1):    log_table[i] = log_table[i//2] +1k_max = log_table[n] if n&gt;0 else 0st = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(k_max+1)]for i in range(n+1):    st[0][i] = prefix_sum[i]for k in range(1, k_max+1):    for i in range(0, n+1 - (1&lt;&lt;k) +1):        st[k][i] = min(st[k-1][i], st[k-1][i + (1 &lt;&lt;(k-1))])Then, the range min query function:def query_min(l, r):    length = r - l +1    k = log_table[length]    return min(st[k][l], st[k][r - (1&lt;&lt;k) +1])But need to handle the case where l &gt;r: return infinity.Thus, in code:def query_min(l, r):    if l &gt;r:        return float(&#39;inf&#39;)    length = r - l +1    k = log_table[length]    return min(st[k][l], st[k][r - (1 &lt;&lt;k) +1])Now, iterate over all pairs (i,j):total =0for i in range(1, n+1, 2):  # i is odd.    for j in range(2, n+1, 2):  # j is even.        if i &gt;j:            continue        # process pair (i,j)        middle_start = i+1        middle_end = j-1        if middle_start &gt; middle_end:            S_m =0            max_neg_S =0        else:            S_m = prefix_sum[middle_end] - prefix_sum[i]            # find min_prefix in [middle_start, middle_end]            min_prefix = query_min(middle_start, middle_end)            max_neg_S = prefix_sum[i] - min_prefix        # compute a_min and a_max        a_min = max(1, 1 - S_m, max_neg_S)        a_max = min(c[i-1], (c[j-1] - S_m))        if a_min &gt; a_max:            continue        else:            count = a_max - a_min +1            total += countprint(total)This should work.Now, let&#39;s test against the sample inputs.Sample Input 1:54 1 2 3 1The c array is [4,1,2,3,1].The blocks are:1:4 (odd) → contrib[1] =42:1 (even) → contrib[2] =-13:2 (odd) → contrib[3] =24:3 (even) → contrib[4] =-35:1 (odd) → contrib[5] =1prefix_sum:0, 4, 3, 5, 2,3.For pairs (i,j):For example, i=3 (c_i=2), j=4 (c_j=3).Middle_start=4, middle_end=3 → invalid. So S_m=0, max_neg_S=0.a_min = max(1,1,0) →1.a_max = min(2, 3 -0=3) →2.So count is 2-1+1=2. But according to the sample input 1, this may not be a valid case.Wait, let&#39;s see the sample input 1:The first example&#39;s input is n=5, c = [4,1,2,3,1]. The output is 5.According to the code:Iterate i=1,3,5.For i=3 (block3, which is odd), j=4 (block4, even).Middle_start =4, middle_end=3 → invalid. So treated as no middle blocks.So S_m=0.a_min=1.a_max = min(2,3) →2.Count is 2.But the sample output&#39;s count for this pair is 1 (the third case in the explanation: subsequence from 4th to 5th character is &#39;()&#39;).Wait, but in the code&#39;s calculation, this pair contributes 2.But according to the sample explanation, this case is one of the 5.Hmm, there&#39;s a discrepancy here.Ah, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the code.In the first sample input, the code will iterate for i=3 (block3, which is an odd block, contributing &#39;(&#39;, 2 characters), j=4 (block4, even, 3 characters).The code considers the pair (i=3, j=4).Middle_start =4, middle_end =3 → no middle blocks.So S_m=0.a_min =max(1, 1-0=1, 0) →1.a_max = min(2, 3) →2.Thus, the count is 2. But according to the sample, this pair contributes 1.What&#39;s the issue?Ah, in this case, the code assumes that the substring starts with a=1 or 2 &#39;(&#39; from block3, and ends with d= a +0 = a &#39;)&#39; from block4.So for a=1: d=1. So the substring is 1 &#39;(&#39; from block3 and 1 &#39;)&#39; from block4 → &#39;()&#39;, which is valid.For a=2: 2 &#39;(&#39; from block3, 2 &#39;)&#39; from block4. But block4&#39;s c_j is 3, so this is allowed. So &#39;(( ))&#39;.This is a valid regular sequence of length 4. So why isn&#39;t this counted in the sample?Looking back at the sample&#39;s explanation:The sample&#39;s first example&#39;s output is 5, which includes:2. Subsequence from 4th to 5th character: ().The code&#39;s calculation for i=3 and j=4 (blocks3 and4) gives a count of 2, but the sample explanation includes only one such case.This indicates a mistake in the code&#39;s approach.But why?Ah, because the original bracket sequence in the first sample is &quot;(((()(()))(&quot;.Wait, the sample&#39;s first example&#39;s input is [4,1,2,3,1], which corresponds to:Block1:4 → &#39;((((&#39;Block2:1 → &#39;)&#39;Block3:2 → &#39;(( &#39;Block4:3 → &#39;)))&#39;Block5:1 → &#39;(&#39;So the entire sequence is &#39;(((() ))) (&#39;.Wait, no. Block3 is 2 &#39;(&#39;, so &#39;(( &#39;, block4 is 3 &#39;)&#39;, so &#39;)))&#39;.So the full sequence is &#39;((( ) (( ))) (&#39;.But the code&#39;s pair (i=3, j=4) corresponds to taking some &#39;(&#39; from block3 and some &#39;)&#39; from block4.So a=1: substring is &#39;(()))&#39; → no, block3 is 2 &#39;(&#39;, so taking 1 of them is &#39;(&#39;, block4 is 3 &#39;)&#39;, taking 1 → &#39;)&#39;, so the substring is &#39;()&#39;, which is valid.a=2: taking 2 from block3 ( &#39;(( &#39;), and 2 from block4 ( &#39;))&#39; → &#39;(() )&#39;.Which is a valid regular sequence.So the code&#39;s count is 2 for this pair.But the sample&#39;s first example output is 5, and according to the explanation, there is one such case (item 2). So where are these two sequences in the sample explanation?The sample&#39;s explanation lists 5 valid sequences, including:2. Subsequence from 4th to 5th character: ().This corresponds to a=1 from block3 and d=1 from block4. But the code&#39;s calculation for this pair (i=3, j=4) gives 2, which would make the sample&#39;s output have more than 5.Thus, this indicates a mistake in the code&#39;s logic.The error must be in the code&#39;s approach.Why does the code count 2 for this pair, but the sample has only 1?Ah, perhaps the code is considering a=1 and a=2 as valid, but the corresponding sequences are not valid in the original bracket sequence.But why?Because when i=3 and j=4, the substring starts in block3 and ends in block4.But in the original sequence, block3 is &#39;(( &#39;, and block4 is &#39;)))&#39;.So the substring would be a &#39;(&#39;, followed by &#39;))&#39; from block4.Wait, no. When j=4, the code considers the substring as a part of block3 (a characters) and a part of block4 (d characters). The middle blocks are between i+1 and j-1. Since i=3, j=4, the middle blocks are 4&#39;s previous blocks: i+1 =4, j-1=3. So no middle blocks.Thus, the substring is a characters from block3 ( &#39;(&#39;, a=1 or 2) and d =a from block4 ( &#39;)&#39;, d=1 or 2).So the substring is &#39;()&#39; (a=1) or &#39;(( )) &#39; (a=2), both of which are valid.But according to the sample explanation, only one of these is counted.Ah, the sample explanation lists 5 valid sequences:1. Subsequence from 3rd to 10th character: (()(())).This is formed by multiple blocks.2. Subsequence from 4th to 5th character: ().This is block3&#39;s first &#39;(&#39; and block4&#39;s first &#39;)&#39;.3. Subsequence from 4th to 9th character: ()(()).This involves multiple blocks.4. Subsequence from 6th to 9th character: (()).5. Subsequence from 7th to 8th character: ().Thus, the code&#39;s count for pair (3,4) (i=3, j=4) is 2 (a=1 and 2), but the sample includes only a=1 (item 2).This indicates a mistake in the code&#39;s approach.The code is counting both a=1 and a=2 as valid, but according to the sample, only one is valid.Thus, there must be a mistake in the code&#39;s logic.The problem is that the code&#39;s approach assumes that any a in the computed range is valid, but in reality, some of these a&#39;s may lead to a balance that drops below zero during the processing of the middle blocks.But in this case, there are no middle blocks. Thus, the processing steps are empty.Thus, the balance after the a is a, then subtract d =a.The balance during the sequence is:After a &#39;(&#39;, balance is a.After d &#39;)&#39;, balance is 0.During the processing of the sequence, the balance is a, then a-1, a-2, etc. down to 0.Thus, as long as a &gt;=1, the balance is non-negative at every step.Thus, both a=1 and a=2 are valid.But the sample&#39;s explanation only includes one of these.This suggests a discrepancy between the problem&#39;s actual scenario and the code&#39;s logic.But according to the problem statement, the first sample&#39;s output is 5. But according to the code&#39;s calculation for i=3 and j=4, the code would count 2, which would contribute to the total. But according to the sample explanation, this pair contributes 1.This suggests that the code&#39;s logic is incorrect.Why is this happening?Ah, perhaps the code&#39;s logic is incorrect because it does not account for the actual positions of the brackets in the original sequence.For example, in the case where i=3 and j=4, the code assumes that the a &#39;(&#39; from block3 are taken from the start of the block, but in reality, the code allows any a consecutive &#39;(&#39; from block3. However, the regular sequence must be a continuous substring.But in the original sequence, block3 is followed by block4. So taking a=2 from block3 and d=2 from block4 would form &#39;(() )&#39;, which is a valid sequence.But according to the sample explanation, this is not counted. So why?Looking back at the sample explanation:The sample explanation lists five valid sequences. The third example is &#39;()(())&#39;, which starts at block3&#39;s first &#39;(&#39; and ends at block4&#39;s third &#39;)&#39;.But the code&#39;s pair (i=3, j=4) would allow a=1 and d=1 (item 2), and a=2 and d=2 (which is &#39;(() )&#39;).But according to the sample explanation, the second item is the only one from this pair. So why is the code counting two, but the sample counts one?This suggests that the code&#39;s approach is incorrect.The mistake is that the code is considering a=2 and d=2 as a valid pair for (i=3, j=4), but in the original sequence, this would form &#39;(() ))&#39;, which is not a valid sequence.Wait, no. &#39;(() )) &#39; is 2 &#39;(&#39; followed by 2 &#39;)&#39;, which is &#39;(() )&#39;, which is not a valid sequence. Because the first two &#39;(&#39; are closed by two &#39;)&#39;, but the sequence is &#39;(() )&#39;, which is not valid. The first &#39;(&#39; has a closing &#39;)&#39;, but the second &#39;(&#39; has a closing &#39;)&#39;, but the order is &#39; ( ( ) ) &#39;, which is &#39;(( ))&#39;, which is valid.Wait, &#39;(( )) &#39; is a valid sequence. So for a=2 and d=2, the code counts it as valid.So why does the sample explanation not include this?Ah, this indicates that the code&#39;s approach is incorrect. Because the sample&#39;s explanation has five valid sequences, but according to the code&#39;s calculation, this pair contributes 2, leading to a total of 5 only if other pairs contribute 3.But according to the first sample&#39;s input, the code&#39;s calculation would be:For pairs (i=3,j=4) count is 2.Other pairs:i=1,j=2: a_min=1, a_max= min(4,1) =1. count=1.i=3,j=4:2.i=5,j=6: but j can&#39;t be 6 as n=5.Other pairs:i=1,j=4:Middle blocks are 2 and 3.contrib of block2 is -1 (even), block3 is 2 (odd).sum_odds_middle =2, sum_evens_middle=1.S_m=2-1=1.Processing middle blocks:Block2: contrib=-1. S_1 =-1. balance after processing is a-1 &gt;=0 → a &gt;=1.Block3: contrib=2. S_2 =1. balance is a-1 +2 =a+1 &gt;=0 → a &gt;=-1. But a &gt;=1 from previous step.Thus, max_neg_S = max(1, 0) → 1.a_min = max(1, 1-1=0, 1) →1.a_max = min(4, 3-1=2) →2.Thus, count is 2.Thus, this pair contributes 2.So total so far is 1 (i=1,j=2) +2 (i=3,j=4) + 2 (i=1,j=4) =5.But according to the sample explanation, the total is 5.Thus, the code&#39;s approach correctly calculates the sample input.Thus, the code is correct.Thus, the sample explanation must have other pairs contributing to the count.But according to the code&#39;s calculation, the first sample&#39;s code will have a total of:For i=1,j=2: 1.i=1,j=4:2.i=3,j=4:2.i=5,j=6: not applicable (n=5).Other pairs:i=1,j=6: invalid.i=3,j=6: invalid.Thus, the code&#39;s total is 1+2+2=5, which matches the sample.Thus, the code is correct.Thus, the code&#39;s approach is correct.Thus, the code will correctly handle the samples.Thus, the code should be correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid regular bracket subsequences in a given compressed sequence of brackets.

Iterate Over Pairs: For each valid pair of opening and closing blocks, we determine the valid range of starting brackets from the opening block and ending brackets from the closing block.

Formally, the values are equalized if for each i from l to r holds a_i = b_i.To perform a balancing operation an even number of indices must be selected, such that l ≤ pos_1 &lt; pos_2 &lt; ... &lt; pos_k ≤ r. Next the items of array a at positions pos_1, pos_3, pos_5, ... get incremented by one and the items of array b at positions pos_2, pos_4, pos_6, ... get incremented by one.William wants to find out if it is possible to equalize the values of elements in two arrays for each segment using some number of balancing operations, and what is the minimal number of operations required for that. Note that for each segment the operations are performed independently.InputThe first line contains a two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the size of arrays a and b and the number of segments.The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).Each of the next q lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i &lt; r_i ≤ n), the edges of segments.OutputFor each segment output a single number — the minimal number of balancing operations needed or &quot;-1&quot; if it is impossible to equalize segments of arrays.ExampleInput8 50 1 2 9 3 2 7 52 2 1 9 4 1 5 82 61 72 47 85 8Output131-1-1NoteFor the first segment from 2 to 6 you can do one operation with pos = [2, 3, 5, 6], after this operation the arrays will be: a = [0, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 7, 5], b = [2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 5, 8]. Arrays are equal on a segment from 2 to 6 after this operation.For the second segment from 1 to 7 you can do three following operations:   1. pos = [1, 3, 5, 6]   2. pos = [1, 7]   3. pos = [2, 7] After these operations, the arrays will be: a = [2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 7, 5], b = [2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 7, 8].

Let&#39;s read the problem carefully and understand what&#39;s required.The problem is about two arrays a and b. For each query, which is a segment l to r, I have to determine if it&#39;s possible to make a[i] equal to b[i] for all positions from l to r using the minimal number of balancing operations. If it&#39;s impossible, output -1; else, output the minimal number of operations.The balancing operation works by selecting an even number of positions. Then, in array a, the odd-indexed selected positions (like pos_1, pos_3, etc.) are incremented by 1. In array b, the even-indexed selected positions (pos_2, pos_4, etc.) are incremented by 1. So each operation affects a and b in these selected positions, but the selection must have even length.First, I need to model what each operation does and find the conditions under which the arrays can be equalized.Let me think: after some operations, what&#39;s the effect on a[i] and b[i]?Each time a position i is selected in an operation, it can be in an odd or even position in the selection list. For example, if a position is selected as the first in the list (pos_1), then a[i] increases by 1. If it&#39;s selected as the second (pos_2), then b[i] increases by 1. So each time i is part of a pair in an operation, it could contribute to a[i] and/or b[i].Wait, but each operation&#39;s selection is a list of even length. So, for example, if in one operation, positions x and y are selected (in order), then a[x] +=1, and b[y] +=1. If in another operation, x is selected as part of another pair, say as the first element, then a[x] increases again.So, for each position i, the number of times it appears in an odd position (like pos_1, pos_3, etc.) across all operations determines how much a[i] is increased. Similarly, the number of times it appears in even positions in any operation determines how much b[i] is increased.But since the selection of positions in each operation can vary, perhaps there&#39;s a way to model the required increments for a[i] and b[i] in terms of certain variables.The goal is for, after all operations, a[i] + delta_a[i] = b[i] + delta_b[i] for each i in [l, r]. So, the difference (a[i] - b[i]) must equal (delta_b[i] - delta_a[i]).Now, delta_a[i] is the number of times i was in an odd position in any operation. delta_b[i] is the number of times it was in an even position in any operation.So, a[i] + delta_a[i] = b[i] + delta_b[i]=&gt; delta_a[i] - delta_b[i] = b[i] - a[i]Wait, rearranged: (a[i] + delta_a[i]) = (b[i] + delta_b[i]) → delta_a[i] - delta_b[i] = b[i] - a[i] → delta_b[i] - delta_a[i] = a[i] - b[i]. Wait, perhaps I should re-arrange correctly:a[i] + delta_a[i] = b[i] + delta_b[i]delta_a[i] - delta_b[i] = b[i] - a[i]So the difference between the number of times a[i] was increased (delta_a) and the number of times b[i] was increased (delta_b) is equal to (b[i] - a[i]).But delta_a and delta_b are related to how many times the position i is chosen in operations, and in which positions (even or odd in the operation&#39;s list).Let me model delta_a[i] as x_i, the number of times i was in an odd position in the operation&#39;s list, and delta_b[i] as y_i, the number of times i was in an even position. Then:x_i - y_i = b[i] - a[i]But each operation contributes to x_i and y_i as follows: in an operation, even number of positions are chosen. For each pair (pos1, pos2), (pos3, pos4), etc., in the list, each operation&#39;s selection contributes to x for the first in the pair and y for the second.Wait, perhaps each operation is a list of positions, in order, with even length. For each even k, the 1st, 3rd, etc. (odd indices in the list) are a&#39;s increments, and even indices (2nd,4th, etc.) are b&#39;s increments.So, for a single operation with positions [p1, p2, p3, p4], then:x_p1 +=1 (since p1 is the first, which is an odd index in the list)y_p2 +=1 (p2 is the second, even index in the list)x_p3 +=1 (third, which is the next odd index)y_p4 +=1 (fourth, even index)So, for each operation, the positions are grouped into pairs, and in each pair, the first position contributes to x (a&#39;s increment), the second to y (b&#39;s increment). So each operation is a collection of pairs (p_1, p_2), (p_3, p_4), etc., such that in each pair, p_1 &lt; p_2, p_3 &lt; p_4, etc.Wait, but the selection list must be ordered as pos_1 &lt; pos_2 &lt; ... &lt; pos_k. So in each operation&#39;s selection list, the positions are in strictly increasing order, but they can be any even number of positions. So for example, if the list has 4 positions, they are split into two pairs (pos1, pos2) and (pos3, pos4). For each pair, the first is in an odd position (1st and 3rd in the overall list) and contributes to x (a&#39;s delta), the even positions (2nd and 4th) contribute to y (b&#39;s delta). Wait, no. Wait, in the list of positions in the operation, the first position (pos1) is in index 1 (if 1-based?), but the code example shows that in the first sample, the operation uses positions [2,3,5,6]. So the first element is 2 (pos1), second 3 (pos2), third 5 (pos3), fourth 6 (pos4). Then, for this operation, the a array increments are at pos1 and pos3 (so 2 and 5), and b increments at pos2 and pos4 (3 and 6).So for each operation, the positions are grouped into consecutive pairs. Wait, perhaps not. Because the operation&#39;s selection list can have any even number of positions, ordered in increasing order, and for each position in the list, if it&#39;s at an odd index (1-based) in the list, then it&#39;s part of the a increments (x), even index (2-based) are part of the b increments (y). So, for the list [p1, p2, p3, p4], the a increments are p1 and p3 (since 1 and 3 are odd indices), and the b increments are p2 and p4 (even indices).So each operation can choose any even number of positions (could be 2,4,6,...) in any order (but in increasing order) and split them into pairs where the first in each pair is for a, the second for b.But the way the operations are applied can vary. So the problem reduces to determining whether there exists a sequence of operations (each selecting even number of positions) such that for each position i in [l..r], x_i - y_i = b[i] - a[i], where x_i is the number of times i was selected in a&#39;s part (odd positions in the operation&#39;s list), and y_i is the number of times it was selected in the b&#39;s part (even positions in the list).But how do the x_i and y_i relate to each other?Wait, each time a position is selected in an operation, it can be in either an a-increment or a b-increment position. So for any i, the number of times it&#39;s in an a-increment position (x_i) plus the number of times it&#39;s in a b-increment position (y_i) is equal to the total number of times it&#39;s selected in any operation.But the key equation is x_i - y_i = b[i] - a[i]. Let&#39;s call this equation (1).Additionally, since the operations must be performed with even-sized selections, each operation contributes an even number of positions. But perhaps the key is to model the variables x_i and y_i such that the total sum over all possible pairs (x_i, y_i) in the segment [l..r] satisfies certain conditions.Hmm. Let&#39;s think of the problem in terms of variables and equations.For each position i in [l..r], equation (1) must hold. So x_i - y_i = (b[i] - a[i]). Let&#39;s call this delta_i = b[i] - a[i].So for each i, x_i - y_i = delta_i. But x_i and y_i are non-negative integers (since they represent counts of how many times the position was selected in a&#39;s or b&#39;s part of operations).Moreover, each operation must select an even number of positions. Each operation can be thought of as adding 1 to x_p for some positions p (those selected in odd indices of the operation&#39;s list) and 1 to y_p for others (even indices in the list). Also, the number of x_p increments and y_p increments in each operation must be equal, since each operation contributes exactly k/2 x&#39;s and k/2 y&#39;s, where k is the even number of positions selected.Wait, yes. Because each operation&#39;s list has even length. For each operation, the number of positions is even, say 2m. Then, in that operation, m positions are in x (a&#39;s increments) and m are in y (b&#39;s increments). So for each operation, the sum over all x_i increments is m, and the sum over all y_i increments is m. Therefore, for each operation, sum(x_i_in_operation) = sum(y_i_in_operation) = m. So the total sum of x across all positions is equal to the total sum of y across all positions, since each operation contributes m x&#39;s and m y&#39;s.Therefore, the sum over all x_i (for the segment) must equal the sum over all y_i. Let&#39;s denote sum_x = sum(x_i for i in l..r) and sum_y = sum(y_i for i in l..r). Then sum_x = sum_y. But each operation contributes m x&#39;s and m y&#39;s, so sum_x and sum_y are both equal to the total number of operations multiplied by m (but since m can vary per operation, sum_x = sum of m_j for each operation j, and same for sum_y). So sum_x = sum_y.But sum_x - sum_y = 0.But from equation (1), sum(x_i) - sum(y_i) = sum(delta_i) over the segment. So sum(delta_i) must be equal to sum_x - sum_y = 0. So sum(delta_i) must be zero for the segment. Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible.So the first condition is that the sum of (b[i] - a[i]) for i in [l..r] must be zero. Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible.So that&#39;s the first check. If sum(delta_i) != 0, output -1.But even if sum(delta_i) is zero, there might be other conditions.Now, for each i, x_i = y_i + delta_i. Since x_i and y_i are non-negative, we have:y_i = x_i - delta_i.But x_i must be &gt;= delta_i (if delta_i is positive) or y_i &gt;= -delta_i (if delta_i is negative). Wait, since y_i can&#39;t be negative. So for x_i to be non-negative, and y_i also non-negative:x_i = y_i + delta_i.So y_i + delta_i &gt;= 0 → y_i &gt;= -delta_i. But delta_i can be positive or negative.Wait, let&#39;s see:If delta_i is positive:x_i = y_i + delta_i → since x_i must be non-negative, y_i can be any non-negative value (since delta_i is positive). But y_i must also be non-negative. So as long as x_i &gt;= delta_i, then y_i = x_i - delta_i &gt;= 0 → x_i &gt;= delta_i. So for delta_i positive, x_i can be any integer &gt;= delta_i, and y_i = x_i - delta_i &gt;=0.But delta_i could be negative. For example, delta_i = -3. Then x_i = y_i -3. Since x_i must be non-negative, y_i must be &gt;=3. So x_i = y_i -3 &gt;=0 → y_i &gt;=3.But how can we model this?Alternatively, perhaps delta_i must be even. Because each operation&#39;s effect on delta_i for a pair of positions (p and q in the same operation) can contribute to certain parity conditions.Wait, let&#39;s think about this. Let&#39;s take two positions in a single operation. Suppose in an operation, we select positions p and q (p &lt; q). Then, x_p increases by 1 (a&#39;s part), and y_q increases by 1 (b&#39;s part). So for p and q, their delta (x - y) changes as follows: for p, delta_p becomes x_p +1 - y_p. For q, delta_q becomes x_q - (y_q +1) → (x_q - y_q) -1. So the total sum (delta_p + delta_q) increases by (1) + (-1) = 0. So each operation affects individual deltas, but the sum remains the same. But wait, the initial sum of deltas (b[i] - a[i]) must be zero. So perhaps the parity of delta_i is important.Wait, perhaps another approach. Let&#39;s consider that the delta_i (x_i - y_i) must equal (b[i] - a[i]). So for each i, x_i - y_i = D_i, where D_i is given as (b[i] - a[i]).But each operation affects x and y variables for pairs of positions. For example, in an operation, if we select positions p and q, then x_p +=1 (since it&#39;s the first in the pair), and y_q +=1 (since it&#39;s the second). So, the deltas for p and q become:delta_p = (x_p +1) - y_p = (x_p - y_p) +1 → D_p +1delta_q = x_q - (y_q +1) → D_q -1So the sum of delta_p and delta_q after the operation is (D_p +1) + (D_q -1) = D_p + D_q. So the sum remains the same. So the sum of deltas for any two positions involved in an operation remains the same. But since each operation can involve any even number of positions (but grouped into pairs?), perhaps the sum of deltas for all positions is preserved.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s see. For each operation with k positions (even number), each operation is a list of positions grouped into pairs. For example, with four positions, the pairs are (1,2) and (3,4) in the list. For each pair (a, b), the operation increases x_a by 1 and y_b by 1. So for each pair, the delta for a is increased by 1, the delta for b is decreased by 1, so the sum of deltas for a and b remains (delta_a + delta_b) = (x_a - y_a) + (x_b - y_b) → after the operation, (x_a +1 - y_a) + (x_b - (y_b +1)) ) → (x_a - y_a +1) + (x_b - y_b -1) → (x_a - y_a) + (x_b - y_b) ) → the sum remains the same. So each pair in the operation contributes a net zero change to the sum of deltas. Since the operation&#39;s list has m pairs, the sum of all deltas in the segment is preserved.But the initial sum of deltas is sum(D_i) for i in [l..r] = sum(b[i] - a[i]). So, if that sum is not zero, it&#39;s impossible. Because each operation preserves the sum, and in order to reach all D_i = (x_i - y_i) which is (b[i] - a[i]), but the sum of D_i must be zero. Wait, no. Because in the problem statement, the desired outcome is that after applying the operations, a[i] + x_i = b[i] + y_i. So x_i - y_i = b[i] - a[i]. So the sum of x_i - y_i over the segment must equal the sum of (b[i] - a[i]). But from the initial problem statement, the sum of (b[i] - a[i]) can be anything. However, earlier we saw that sum(x_i) - sum(y_i) = sum(D_i). But each operation&#39;s effect on sum(x) and sum(y) is that sum(x) increases by m, sum(y) increases by m (for m pairs in the operation). So sum(x) = sum(y), which implies that sum(x) - sum(y) =0. Therefore, sum(D_i) must be zero.Wait, because sum(x_i) - sum(y_i) = sum(D_i). But sum(x_i) = sum(y_i), so sum(D_i) must be zero. That&#39;s a crucial point. So the first condition is that sum of (b[i] - a[i]) for the segment must be zero. Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible.So, for each query, first check if sum(b[i] - a[i]) over l to r is zero. If not, output -1.If sum is zero, then proceed to check other conditions.Now, the next step is to model the problem for the case when the sum is zero. What other conditions must be satisfied?Another thing to note is that the operations can only affect the deltas (x_i - y_i) in certain ways. Each operation can be considered as a set of pairs of positions. Each pair (p, q) in the operation contributes to x_p and y_q. So, each pair (p, q) allows us to adjust the delta_p by +1 and delta_q by -1. But since the delta must be exactly D_i for each i, how can we model this?Alternatively, the required delta for each position is D_i = b[i] - a[i]. So, the problem reduces to whether we can achieve these delta values by a sequence of operations, each consisting of pairs (p, q) where each pair allows delta_p to be increased by 1 and delta_q to be decreased by 1 (or vice versa? Wait, no. Let&#39;s think again. The operation adds to x_p (delta_p increases by 1) and adds to y_q (delta_q decreases by 1). So each pair (p, q) in the operation contributes +1 to delta_p and -1 to delta_q.But the initial deltas (the desired D_i) must be achieved through these operations. So the problem becomes: can we find a set of pairs (p, q) such that each pair contributes +1 to p&#39;s delta and -1 to q&#39;s delta, and after all operations, each delta is exactly D_i. Additionally, the total number of pairs (each operation can have multiple pairs) is the minimal possible.But wait, each operation can be any even number of positions, but they are grouped into consecutive pairs. So, for example, in an operation with four positions (p, q, r, s), it&#39;s equivalent to two pairs: (p, q) and (r, s). Each pair contributes +1 to p&#39;s delta and -1 to q&#39;s delta, then +1 to r&#39;s delta and -1 to s&#39;s delta.So each operation can be broken down into multiple pairs. Each pair in the operation can be considered as a separate adjustment of deltas. But all pairs in an operation are processed in the same step.So, the minimal number of operations is equivalent to the minimal number of times we need to choose any number of non-overlapping pairs (since in each operation, multiple pairs can be selected as long as their positions are ordered) to achieve the required delta_i.But how to model this? Because each operation can handle multiple pairs, the minimal number of operations would be determined by how the pairs can be grouped into operations such that each operation can handle as many pairs as possible.Wait, but each operation can have any even number of positions. So, for example, if we can find multiple pairs that can be grouped into a single operation (as long as their positions are in order), then this would reduce the number of operations. So the minimal number of operations is the minimal number of times we need to create a set of non-overlapping pairs in the segment [l..r], such that each pair is ordered (p &lt; q), and all pairs in the same operation are ordered in the list (p1 &lt; q1 &lt; p2 &lt; q2 &lt; ...). Wait, no. Because in an operation, the positions must be ordered as a list. So for example, in a single operation, the list could be [p, q, r, s], where p &lt; q &lt; r &lt; s. Then, the pairs are (p, q), (r, s). So in this case, the pairs are non-overlapping and ordered. But the pairs can&#39;t have overlapping ranges. For example, if a pair is (p, q) and another (q, r), they can&#39;t be in the same operation&#39;s list because q &lt; r would require that in the list, q comes before r, but the list is ordered as p &lt; q &lt; r &lt; s. So, to include (p, q) and (q, r) in the same operation, the list would have p, q, q, r, which is invalid because positions must be strictly increasing.Therefore, pairs in the same operation cannot share any positions. So each position can be part of at most one pair in a single operation.So, the problem of finding the minimal number of operations reduces to grouping pairs (p, q) into operations such that in each operation, all pairs are non-overlapping and ordered. Each operation can have any even number of positions, but the positions must be ordered and each pair is a consecutive pair in the list.But how does this affect the minimal number of operations? The key is that each operation can handle as many non-overlapping pairs as possible. For example, if we have several pairs that are non-overlapping and ordered, they can all be handled in a single operation.So the minimal number of operations depends on the arrangement of the required pairs (the way the delta_i&#39;s are adjusted) and how they can be grouped into non-overlapping sequences.But this seems complicated. Perhaps there&#39;s another way to model the problem.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph or use prefix sums.Wait, let&#39;s think about the delta_i&#39;s. The sum of delta_i&#39;s is zero. So, for the segment [l..r], sum(delta_i) = 0.Each pair (p, q) in an operation contributes +1 to delta_p and -1 to delta_q. So, the net effect is that delta_p increases by 1, delta_q decreases by 1. The sum remains the same.So, to reach the desired delta_i&#39;s, we need to find a way to apply such operations. Let&#39;s think of the delta_i&#39;s as a sequence of values that need to be adjusted through these operations.But the initial state of delta_i is zero (since before any operations, x_i and y_i are zero), and after some operations, we need delta_i to be D_i = b[i] - a[i].Wait, no. Because the delta_i (x_i - y_i) is D_i. The initial delta_i (before any operations) is zero. The desired delta_i after all operations is D_i. So the problem is equivalent to applying a series of operations (each consisting of pairs of positions) that transforms the initial delta_i (all zeros) into the target D_i&#39;s. Each operation can choose any even number of positions and split them into pairs, each pair contributing +1 to the first&#39;s delta and -1 to the second&#39;s delta.So the minimal number of operations required is the minimal number of steps needed to reach the target delta_i&#39;s, given that each step can adjust multiple pairs (as long as they are non-overlapping and ordered).But how?Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the prefix sums of the delta_i&#39;s. Let&#39;s model this.Let&#39;s consider the array of D_i = b[i] - a[i]. The sum of D_i from l to r is zero.We need to find a way to apply operations (pairs of positions) such that each pair (p, q) in the operation adds +1 to D_p and -1 to D_q. Wait, no. Wait, the initial delta is zero. Then, each operation&#39;s pairs are adding to the delta. So the target delta_i is D_i. So the sum of all operations&#39; contributions must equal D_i for each i.Each pair (p, q) in any operation contributes +1 to p and -1 to q. So the sum over all operations&#39; pairs must result in the delta_i&#39;s.So, the problem can be viewed as covering the required delta_i&#39;s with such pairs. Each pair (p, q) contributes +1 to p and -1 to q.So, the required delta for each i is equal to the number of times i was in a pair as p (the first element) minus the number of times i was in a pair as q (the second element).Let&#39;s denote for each i, the number of times it appears as p in a pair as c_p[i], and as q in a pair as c_q[i]. Then, delta_i = c_p[i] - c_q[i].But each pair (p, q) increases c_p[p] by 1 and c_q[q] by 1.So, delta_i = c_p[i] - c_q[i].But the sum over all delta_i is (sum c_p[i] - sum c_q[i]). But since sum c_p[i] is the total number of pairs (since each pair contributes 1 to c_p[p]), and sum c_q[i] is also the total number of pairs. So sum delta_i = sum (c_p[i] - c_q[i]) = 0. Which matches the condition that sum D_i =0.So, the problem reduces to finding a way to decompose the array D_i into a set of pairs (p, q) such that each pair contributes +1 to D_p and -1 to D_q, and the minimal number of operations needed to achieve this, considering that each operation can have multiple pairs as long as they are ordered in a strictly increasing list of positions (so that pairs in the same operation do not overlap).But how do the operations affect the arrangement of pairs?Each operation is a list of even number of positions, ordered in increasing order. Each consecutive pair in this list forms a (p, q) pair, where p &lt; q.So, for example, in an operation with positions [a, b, c, d], the pairs are (a,b) and (c,d). These pairs are non-overlapping and ordered.Thus, in a single operation, the pairs must be non-overlapping and their positions must be in increasing order.The goal is to group the required pairs into as few operations as possible.The key question is: given the required set of pairs (each contributing +1 and -1 to their positions), how to group them into operations such that in each operation, the pairs are non-overlapping and ordered, and the minimal number of operations is achieved.But how to model this?Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a way to model the required number of operations by considering the prefix sum of the delta array.Let&#39;s consider building a prefix sum array S for the D array. Let S[0] =0, S[i] = D_1 + D_2 + ... + D_i.Wait, but perhaps for the segment [l..r], the prefix sum starts from l. Let me index the positions in [l..r] as 1, 2, ..., m (where m = r - l +1). Let&#39;s compute the prefix sum S for this segment:S[0] =0S[k] = D_l + D_{l+1} + ... + D_{l +k -1} }, for k from 1 to m.But since sum(D_i from l to r) is zero, S[m] =0.Now, when applying a pair (p, q), the contribution to the delta array is +1 at p, -1 at q. The prefix sum after applying this pair would be:At positions up to p-1: no change.At p: S increases by 1.At positions between p and q-1: no change.At q: S decreases by 1.Positions after q: sum is zero again.So, the effect of a pair (p, q) on the prefix sum S is to add 1 to S[k] for all k &gt;= p (if p is in the segment) and subtract 1 from S[k] for all k &gt;= q.But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the maximum absolute value of the prefix sums.Wait, here&#39;s an idea inspired by similar problems: the minimal number of operations needed is equal to the maximum value of the absolute prefix sums of the D array in the segment.Wait, for example, consider the D array as a sequence. The prefix sum S_i is the sum of the first i elements. Then, the maximum S_i (positive) and the minimum S_i (negative) could determine the required steps.But how?Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the problem as follows: each time we select a set of pairs in an operation. Each pair contributes to the delta_i&#39;s, and the sum of their contributions must lead to the desired D array.But perhaps the minimal number of operations required is equal to the maximum absolute value of the prefix sum array.Wait, let&#39;s take the sample input to see.Sample Input:n=8, q=5.a: 0 1 2 9 3 2 7 5b: 2 2 1 9 4 1 5 8So, D_i = b[i] -a[i] for each i:For i=1: 2-0=2i=2:2-1=1i=3:1-2= -1i=4:9-9=0i=5:4-3=1i=6:1-2=-1i=7:5-7=-2i=8:8-5=3Sample queries:First query is 2..6 (positions 2 to 6).D values in this range are:i=2:1i=3:-1i=4:0i=5:1i=6:-1Sum is 1 + (-1) +0 +1 + (-1) =0. So possible.Compute the prefix sums for this segment (indices 2 to 6):Original D array is [1, -1, 0, 1, -1].The prefix sums S would be:S[0] =0S[1] =1S[2] =0S[3] =0S[4] =1S[5] =0The maximum prefix sum is 1, the minimum is 0.But the sample output for this query is 1.Hmm. So according to the sample, the minimal number of operations is 1.Wait, but the maximum absolute prefix sum here is 1. So perhaps the minimal number of operations is equal to the maximum of the absolute values of the prefix sums.But in this case, the maximum is 1, so the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.Another sample query is the second query, 1..7.D values from 1 to7: [2,1,-1,0,1,-1,-2].Sum is 2+1-1+0+1-1-2=0.Compute the prefix sums:S[0] =0S[1] =2S[2] =3S[3] =2S[4] =2S[5] =3S[6] =2S[7] =0.The maximum prefix sum is 3, so according to the hypothesis, the minimal operations would be 3. Which matches the sample output.Third query: 2..4.D values: 1, -1,0. Sum 0.Prefix sums:S[0]=0S[1]=1S[2]=0S[3]=0.Max is 1, so answer is 1. Which matches the sample.Fourth query:7..8. D values are -2 and 3. Sum is 1. So sum is not zero, output -1.Fifth query:5..8. D values:1,-1,-2,3. Sum is 1-1-2+3=1. Again sum not zero.So the hypothesis seems to hold for the samples.Another example: suppose we have a segment where the prefix sums are [0, 2, 1, 3, 0]. The maximum is 3, so the answer would be 3.So the minimal number of operations required is the maximum absolute value of the prefix sums of the D array in the segment.But why is this the case?Let&#39;s think of the prefix sum as the number of &quot;excess&quot; pairs that need to be balanced. Each time the prefix sum increases, it means that up to that point, more a&#39;s increments are needed, which can be achieved by creating pairs that start at this position. The minimal number of operations required would be the maximum such excess.Alternatively, here&#39;s an explanation from a problem with similar characteristics. In the problem where you have to balance parentheses, the number of flips required is determined by the maximum depth of the imbalance. Similarly, here, the maximum prefix sum (or the maximum absolute value of the prefix sums) determines how many layers of operations are needed.Each operation can handle a &quot;layer&quot; of required pairs. For example, if the prefix sum reaches 3 at some point, you need three layers (operations) to handle the required pairs.But how does this relate to the delta array?Let&#39;s model the process. The prefix sum S[k] is the sum of D[1..k]. Since each pair (p, q) in an operation contributes +1 to D[p] and -1 to D[q], the sum S[k] is the sum of all D[1..k] after applying all pairs.But how does the prefix sum change when pairs are applied?Wait, no. The prefix sum S[k] is the sum of the D&#39;s up to k. Each pair (p, q) adds 1 to D[p], subtracts 1 from D[q]. So, the sum of D from 1 to m (the entire segment) is zero. For the prefix sum S[k], adding a pair (p, q) will affect S[k] as follows:If p &lt;=k and q &gt;k: S[k] increases by 1.If p &lt;=k and q &lt;=k: S[k] remains the same (since +1 for p, -1 for q; sum remains the same).If p &gt;k: no effect.So, the effect of a pair (p, q) on the prefix sum S[k] is +1 if p &lt;=k and q &gt;k.Thus, to reach the desired S[k] values (which are the sums of the desired D&#39;s up to each k), we need to have a certain number of pairs that cross each position k. The number of such pairs that cross k is equal to the desired prefix sum S[k].But wait, the desired S[k] is the sum of the D&#39;s up to k, which is equal to the number of pairs that start before or at k and end after k.So, for each k, the number of pairs (p, q) where p &lt;=k &lt; q is exactly S[k].The maximum value of S[k] over the segment is the maximum number of overlapping pairs that cross some position k. Since each operation can handle any number of non-overlapping pairs, the minimal number of operations needed is the maximum S[k], because each such pair that crosses k must be in a separate operation.Wait, perhaps each pair (p, q) where p &lt;=k &lt; q contributes to S[k]. The number of such pairs is S[k]. To arrange these pairs into operations such that in each operation, the pairs are non-overlapping and ordered, the minimal number of operations required is equal to the maximum S[k], because each such pair contributes to S[k], and each operation can handle at most one such pair for each k.Wait, maybe not. For example, if S[k] is 3, then there are 3 pairs crossing k. These pairs must be arranged in such a way that each operation can handle as many as possible. But if the pairs are non-overlapping and ordered, they can all be part of the same operation. For example, pairs (a,b), (c,d), (e,f) where a &lt; b &lt; c &lt;d &lt; e &lt;f. Then, all three can be part of a single operation. But in this case, S[k] would be 3 for some k between a and b, between c and d, and between e and f. However, the maximum prefix sum is 3, but the required operations is 1.Wait, this contradicts the hypothesis. So perhaps the hypothesis is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s think again.Suppose we have the desired delta array D[i], and the prefix sum S[k] = D[1] + D[2] + ... + D[k]. Since each pair (p, q) contributes +1 to D[p] and -1 to D[q], the total contribution to S[k] is +1 if p &lt;=k &lt; q, otherwise 0.So, the sum S[k] is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p &lt;=k &lt; q. Therefore, S[k] is the number of pairs that &quot;cover&quot; position k.The maximum S[k] is the maximum number of overlapping pairs that cover any position k.To arrange all these pairs into operations, each operation can handle as many pairs as possible, provided they are non-overlapping and ordered. The minimal number of operations is then the maximum number of overlapping pairs at any position, which is the maximum S[k].This makes sense. For example, if a position k is covered by 3 pairs, then each of these 3 pairs must be in different operations, since they all overlap at k and thus cannot be in the same operation&#39;s list.Therefore, the minimal number of operations is equal to the maximum value of S[k] in the segment.Thus, the solution is:For each query [l, r]:1. Check if sum(D_i for i in l..r) is zero. If not, output -1.2. Compute the prefix sums S[k] for the segment from l to r.3. Find the maximum value of |S[k]| for k in 0..m (where m = r-l+1).4. The minimal number of operations is that maximum value.Wait, but the prefix sums are all S[k] = sum_{i=1}^k D_i.But the sample input supports this:For the first query (l=2, r=6):D array is [1, -1, 0, 1, -1]prefix sums:0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.The maximum is 1. So the answer is 1.Sample 2: query 1-7.D array is [2,1,-1,0,1,-1,-2]prefix sums:0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0.Maximum is 3. So answer is 3.Sample 3: l=2, r=4.D array is [1,-1,0].prefix sums:0,1,0,0.Maximum is 1.Sample 4: l=7-8. Sum is 1 (D7=-2, D8=3). sum is 1. So output -1.Yes. So this seems to fit.Another test case: suppose D is [1, -1]. prefix sums are 0,1,0. Max is 1. So answer 1.Another example: D = [1, 0, -1]. Sum is 0.prefix sums: 0,1,1,0.Maximum is 1. So answer 1.Another example: D = [2, -2]. sum is 0.prefix sums are 0, 2, 0.Maximum is 2. So answer is 2.Wait, but how?In this case, the required delta for each position is 2 and -2.We need to find pairs such that 2 is the difference between the number of times the first position is in a pair and the second. For position 1: delta is 2. So, c_p[1] - c_q[1] = 2.For position 2: c_p[2] - c_q[2] =-2.But how can this be achieved?Each operation can select two positions. For example:Operation 1: select positions 1 and 2. Then, for the first pair (1,2), delta_1 +=1, delta_2 -=1.Operation 2: select positions 1 and 2 again. Then, delta_1 +=1, delta_2 -=1.But this would require two operations, each with a pair (1,2). So after two operations, delta_1 is 2, delta_2 is -2. Which matches the required. So the answer is 2, which matches the maximum prefix sum of 2.Thus, the hypothesis holds.So the minimal number of operations is the maximum prefix sum S[k], where S is the prefix sum of the D array in the segment, and the maximum is taken over all positions (including the prefix sum up to each position).Thus, the algorithm is:For each query l to r:1. Compute the sum of D_i (b[i]-a[i]) for i in [l..r]. If sum !=0, output -1.2. Otherwise, compute the prefix sums S of the D array in the segment.3. Find the maximum absolute value of S. This is the answer.Wait, but what about the case where some prefix sums are negative? For example, D array is [-1, 1]. Sum is zero. The prefix sums are 0, -1, 0. The maximum absolute value is 1. So the answer is 1.But let&#39;s see:We need to have delta_1 =-1 and delta_2 =1.To achieve this, we need to have c_p[1] - c_q[1] =-1.c_p[2] - c_q[2] =1.This can be done by having a pair (2,1) (but positions must be in order). Wait, no. Because in an operation&#39;s list, positions must be in increasing order. So a pair (2,1) is invalid. All pairs must have p &lt; q.Ah, right. So pairs can only be (p, q) where p &lt; q.So, in this example, D array is [-1,1]. How can we achieve this with pairs (p &lt; q)?For delta_1 =-1: c_p[1] - c_q[1] =-1 → c_q[1] = c_p[1] +1.For delta_2=1: c_p[2] - c_q[2] =1 → c_p[2] = c_q[2] +1.So, possible solution: one pair (2, x), but x must be larger than 2. But the segment is only positions 1 and 2. So x can&#39;t be larger than 2. So this seems impossible.Wait, but the segment is l=1, r=2. The pairs can only be (1,2). Each time we select this pair, it contributes +1 to delta_1 and -1 to delta_2.But the desired deltas are delta_1 =-1 and delta_2=1.So how many pairs (1,2) would do that?If we apply the pair (1,2) once, delta_1 increases by 1 (to 1) and delta_2 decreases by 1 (to -1). That&#39;s not desired.But our desired delta_1 is -1. So this suggests that it&#39;s impossible. But according to the previous hypothesis, the maximum prefix sum&#39;s absolute value is 1, but the answer would be 1. But in reality, it&#39;s impossible.So there&#39;s a problem with the hypothesis.Wait, what&#39;s the sum of the D array? D1 is -1, D2 is 1. Sum is 0.The prefix sums are:S0=0.S1 = D1 =-1.S2= D1 + D2= 0.So the maximum absolute value is 1.But according to the earlier reasoning, the answer should be 1, but in reality, it&#39;s impossible.So the hypothesis is incorrect. This suggests that there&#39;s a missing condition.This example shows that the initial approach is not sufficient. So, what&#39;s wrong here?In this case, the desired delta array is [-1, 1], sum is 0. But there&#39;s no way to create these deltas with pairs (p, q) where p &lt; q.Because each pair (p, q) contributes +1 to p and -1 to q.So, for delta_1 =-1 and delta_2=1, we need:delta_1 = c_p[1] - c_q[1] =-1delta_2 = c_p[2] - c_q[2] =1.But since p &lt; q, the only possible pairs are (1,2).Each such pair contributes:c_p[1] increases by 1 → delta_1 +=1.c_q[2] increases by 1 → delta_2 -=1.So, each time we select (1,2), delta_1 increases by 1 and delta_2 decreases by 1.The desired delta is delta_1 =-1 and delta_2=1. So to reach this, we need:delta_1 = -1 = (number of times 1 is in p) - (number of times 1 is in q).But 1 can only be in p in pair (1,2). So c_p[1] is the number of times (1,2) is selected, and c_q[1] is zero (since 1 can&#39;t be in q in any pair, because pairs are p &lt; q).Similarly, c_q[2] is the number of times (1,2) is selected (since 2 is in q in the pair), and c_p[2] is zero (since 2 can&#39;t be in p in any pair, as q must be larger than p).So:delta_1 = c_p[1] - c_q[1] = c_p[1] - 0 = c_p[1] = -1 → which is impossible, since c_p[1] can&#39;t be negative.This is a contradiction. So the desired delta is impossible to achieve, so the answer should be -1. But according to the previous hypothesis, the sum is zero and the maximum absolute prefix sum is 1, so the answer would be 1. Which is wrong.So the hypothesis is incorrect.Therefore, there must be another condition that needs to be checked.What&#39;s the problem here?The prefix sum approach works when all the prefix sums are non-negative, but in this case, the prefix sum is -1. So perhaps the maximum of the absolute values of the prefix sums is not sufficient. We need to ensure that all prefix sums are non-negative and the maximum is the required answer.But in the example above, the prefix sum is -1. So according to the new condition, the answer would be impossible, but the sum is zero and the maximum absolute prefix sum is 1. So what&#39;s the correct approach?Let me think again. The example shows that even if the sum is zero and the maximum prefix sum is 1, it&#39;s impossible.So what&#39;s the correct way to model this?The key is that each pair (p, q) must have p &lt; q. So, when building the prefix sums, all S[k] must be non-negative. Because each pair contributes +1 to S[k] if p &lt;=k &lt; q. But the pairs are ordered p &lt; q, so the contribution to the prefix sums is always non-negative.Wait, no. Because for a pair (p, q), the contribution to S[k] is +1 if p &lt;=k &lt; q. So for k &gt;=p and k &lt; q, S[k] increases by 1. So the prefix sums are always non-negative if all pairs are processed in this way.But the desired prefix sums can be negative, as in the example. Which is impossible to achieve.So the correct condition is that all prefix sums must be non-negative. Because each pair (p, q) contributes to the prefix sums in a way that can only add to them, not subtract.But wait, no. The desired S[k] is the sum of D[i] up to k. But D[i] is the sum of the pairs that contribute to it. So the desired S[k] must be the number of pairs (p, q) where p &lt;=k &lt; q. Since each such pair contributes +1 to S[k], the desired S[k] must be non-negative.Ah! So the prefix sums S[k] must be non-negative for all k. Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible.So the correct conditions are:1. The sum of D[i] over the segment is zero.2. All prefix sums S[k] are non-negative.3. The minimal number of operations is the maximum S[k].In the example where D is [-1, 1], the sum is zero. The prefix sums are:S0=0.S1= -1 (violates condition 2).So it&#39;s impossible, hence output -1.So, the correct approach is:For each query [l, r]:1. Check if the sum of D[i] over l..r is zero. If not, output -1.2. Compute the prefix sums S of the D array in the segment.3. Check if all prefix sums (including those during the computation) are non-negative. If any is negative, output -1.4. The minimal number of operations is the maximum prefix sum.This resolves the earlier example.Let&#39;s test this.In the example where D is [-1,1], sum is zero. But the prefix sums are 0, -1, 0. The prefix sum S1 is -1, which is invalid. So output -1.Another example: D is [2,-2]. sum is zero. prefix sums are 0, 2, 0. All are non-negative. Max is 2. So answer is 2.Another example: D is [1,-1]. sum zero. prefix sums 0,1,0. All non-negative. Answer is 1.In the example where D is [1, -1, 0, 1, -1] (first sample query), the prefix sums are 0,1,0,0,1,0. All non-negative. Max is 1. Answer 1.So this approach seems correct.So the steps for each query are:- Compute sum(D_i) for l..r. If not zero, output -1.- Compute prefix sums of D_i in the segment. Check if any prefix sum is negative. If yes, output -1.- Otherwise, the answer is the maximum prefix sum.So how to compute the prefix sums for a segment [l..r] efficiently?Constraints are n and q up to 1e5. So for each query, we need O(1) time to compute the sum of D_i, and O(1) time to compute the prefix sums&#39; maximum and check for negatives.But how can we do this for arbitrary segments?To handle this, we can precompute the prefix sums and some data structures to allow range sum and range maximum/minimum queries.But the prefix sums are for the entire array, but each query is about a segment [l..r], which is a contiguous part of the array. The prefix sums for the segment would start from 0, then D[l], D[l] + D[l+1], etc.So, for each query, the prefix sums for the segment are:S_0 = 0S_1 = D[l]S_2 = D[l] + D[l+1]...S_m = sum(D[l..r}) = 0 (since sum is zero)We need to compute these S values and check two things: all S_i &gt;=0, and the maximum S_i.So, the problem reduces to processing each query by:1. Check if the sum of D in [l..r] is zero.2. Check if all prefix sums of the D array in [l..r] are non-negative.3. Find the maximum prefix sum in the segment.If any of the first two conditions are violated, output -1. Else, output the maximum prefix sum.Now, how to do this efficiently for large n and q?First, compute the array D as b[i] - a[i].Then, for sum queries, we can use a prefix sum array for D. Let&#39;s call it sumD, where sumD[i] = sum(D[1..i]). The sum from l to r is sumD[r] - sumD[l-1]. If this is not zero, output -1.Second, for the prefix sums of the segment [l..r], we need to compute the prefix sums starting from D[l], D[l]+D[l+1], etc.But these prefix sums can be expressed using sumD:The prefix sum for the segment up to position k (l &lt;=k &lt;=r) is sumD[k] - sumD[l-1].But we need to compute the prefix sums for the segment as S_0=0, S_1 = D[l], S_2 = D[l]+D[l+1], etc.Which is equivalent to sumD[l] - sumD[l-1], sumD[l+1] - sumD[l-1], etc.So, the prefix sum for the segment is S_i (i=0..m, where m=r-l+1) where S_0=0, S_1 = sumD[l] - sumD[l-1}, S_2 = sumD[l+1] - sumD[l-1}, and so on until S_m = sumD[r] - sumD[l-1} =0.But to compute the maximum and check for negatives, we need to find the maximum value of sumD[k] - sumD[l-1} for k in [l..r], and also ensure that all these values are &gt;=0.But sumD[k] - sumD[l-1} must be &gt;=0 for all k in [l..r}.Additionally, the maximum of these values is the answer.So the problem reduces to, for each query [l, r], if sumD[r] - sumD[l-1} ==0, then compute the maximum of (sumD[k] - sumD[l-1}) for k in [l..r}, and check that all such values are &gt;=0.If so, the answer is the maximum. Otherwise, output -1.So, how to compute this efficiently?We can precompute sumD, and for each query, compute the sum as sumD[r] - sumD[l-1}. If not zero, output -1.Then, for the range [l..r}, we need to find the maximum value of sumD[k} in this range, and subtract sumD[l-1} from it. Also, we need to check that all sumD[k} &gt;= sumD[l-1} for k in [l..r}.Because sumD[k} - sumD[l-1} &gt;=0 for all k in [l..r} is equivalent to sumD[k} &gt;= sumD[l-1} for all k in [l..r}.So, to check this, the minimum sumD[k} in [l..r} must be &gt;= sumD[l-1}.If this is true, then all sumD[k} - sumD[l-1} are &gt;=0.The maximum of sumD[k} - sumD[l-1} is (max_sumD_in_range - sumD[l-1}).So, for each query:If sumD[r] != sumD[l-1}, output -1.Else:- Find the minimum sumD[k} in the range [l..r}.- If the minimum &lt; sumD[l-1}, output -1.Else:- Find the maximum sumD[k} in the range [l..r}.- The answer is (maximum_sumD - sumD[l-1}).Thus, the problem reduces to range minimum and range maximum queries on the sumD array.To handle these efficiently, we can build a segment tree or use a sparse table for range min and max queries.Given the constraints (n up to 1e5, q up to 1e5), a sparse table is appropriate, as it allows O(1) queries after O(n log n) preprocessing.So the steps are:1. Compute sumD array.2. Preprocess sumD for range min and range max queries.3. For each query [l, r}:   a. Check if sumD[r] != sumD[l-1}. If yes, output -1.   b. Compute the minimum sumD in [l, r}. If min_sumD &lt; sumD[l-1}, output -1.   c. Compute the maximum sumD in [l, r}. The answer is max_sumD - sumD[l-1}.   d. Output the answer.Thus, this approach works.Now, let&#39;s test this with the example where D is [-1, 1}:sumD[0}=0sumD[1}= -1sumD[2}=0.For query l=1, r=2.sumD[r} =0, sumD[l-1}=sumD[0}=0. So sum is zero.Check min sumD in [1,2} is min(-1, 0) =-1. sumD[l-1}=0. So min &lt;0 → output -1. Correct.Another example: D is [2,-2}, sumD is [0, 2, 0}.Query l=1, r=2.sumD[r}=0 == sumD[l-1}=0.min_sumD in [1,2} is min(2,0) =0 &gt;=0.max_sumD is max(2,0) =2.Answer is 2-0=2.Which is correct.Another example where the D array is [1, -1, 0, 1, -1} (first sample query):sumD for the entire array is not needed. For the segment l=2 to r=6 (indices 2-6 in 1-based), which corresponds to positions 2,3,4,5,6.sumD for the entire array is sum up to each position. But for the query, the sum of the segment is zero.The sumD for the segment&#39;s prefix sums is sumD[l-1} + D[l}, sumD[l-1} + D[l}+ D[l+1}, etc.But in terms of the sumD array:sumD in the query&#39;s segment:sumD[l-1} is sumD[1} =2 (from the sample input).sumD[2} =2 +1=3.sumD[3}=3-1=2.sumD[4}=2+0=2.sumD[5}=2+1=3.sumD[6}=3-1=2.sumD[7}=2-2=0.sumD[8}=0+3=3.But for the first query l=2, r=6:sumD[r} = sumD[6} =2.sumD[l-1} =sumD[1} =2. So sumD[r} - sumD[l-1} =0. Proceed.Check min sumD in [2..6} is min(3,2,2,3,2) =2. Which is &gt;= sumD[1}=2. So okay.Max sumD in [2..6} is 3. Answer is 3-2=1. Which matches the sample.Yes.Thus, this approach works.Now, to implement this in Python.But the problem is to process q=1e5 queries efficiently. In Python, using a sparse table for range min and max is feasible.So the steps are:- Precompute sumD array.- Preprocess two sparse tables: one for range minimum, one for range maximum.For each query:- l and r are given as 1-based indices.- Check sumD[r] == sumD[l-1}. If not, output -1.- Compute min_sum = range_min(l, r).- If min_sum &lt; sumD[l-1}, output -1.- Compute max_sum = range_max(l, r).- Output max_sum - sumD[l-1}.So, the code would look like this.But how to handle the sumD array?sumD[0} =0.sumD[i} = sumD[i-1} + D[i-1} (assuming 0-based arrays in Python).Wait, in Python, it&#39;s easier to make the sumD array 1-based. For example:sumD[0} =0.sumD[1} = D[1}.sumD[2} = sumD[1} + D[2}.But in code:D is computed as [b[i} - a[i} for i in 0..n-1}.sumD is a list of length n+1. sumD[0} =0.sumD[i} = sumD[i-1} + D[i-1}.Thus, sumD[i} represents the sum of the first i elements of D (assuming D is 0-based).Then, for a query l, r (1-based in the problem&#39;s input), the sum from l to r is sumD[r} - sumD[l-1}.Which matches the problem&#39;s input.So, in code:n, q = map(int, input().split())a = list(map(int, input().split()))b = list(map(int, input().split()))D = [b[i] - a[i] for i in range(n)]sumD = [0] * (n+1)for i in range(1, n+1):    sumD[i] = sumD[i-1] + D[i-1]Then, build sparse tables for range min and max.Implementing sparse tables in Python.The sparse table for range minimum and maximum can be built as follows.For each, the sparse table is a table where st[k][i} represents the min/max in the interval starting at i, of length 2^k.Preprocessing for st_min and st_max.For each k from 1 to log2(n} +1:   for each i, if the interval i to i+2^k -1 is within n, the value is the min/max between the two previous intervals.But in practice, for Python, we can build the sparse tables for range min and range max.Once the sparse tables are built, for any query [l, r}, we can compute the min and max in O(1) time.The code for building the sparse tables and querying is standard.But with n up to 1e5, the sparse table for each function (min and max) would require O(n log n) space, which is manageable (about 20 * 1e5 = 2e6 elements per table).Thus, the code would look like this.Now, the sample input:Sample Input:8 50 1 2 9 3 2 7 52 2 1 9 4 1 5 8D is:2-0=22-1=11-2=-19-9=04-3=11-2=-15-7=-28-5=3So D = [2,1,-1,0,1,-1,-2,3}sumD is:sumD[0} =0sumD[1} =2sumD[2} =3sumD[3} =2sumD[4} =2sumD[5} =3sumD[6} =2sumD[7} =0sumD[8} =3For query 2..6 (l=2, r=6 in 1-based):sumD[6} =2, sumD[1} =2 → sum is 0.range_min(2,6}: positions 2 to6 in sumD are sumD[2}=3, sumD[3}=2, sumD[4}=2, sumD[5}=3, sumD[6}=2. So the min is 2.sumD[l-1} = sumD[1}=2. min_sum &gt;=2 → yes.range_max is 3. So answer is 3-2=1.Which matches the sample.Thus, the code works.So the final code will:- Compute sumD.- Build sparse tables for range min and max.- Process each query.Thus, the Python code will be as follows.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if it&#39;s possible to equalize the values of two arrays a and b over a given segment using the minimal number of balancing operations. If it&#39;s impossible, we should return -1. Otherwise, we return the minimal number of operations required. Approach1. Difference Array (D): Compute the difference array D where each element D[i] is the difference between the corresponding elements of arrays b and a, i.e., D[i] = b[i] - a[i].2. Prefix Sum Array (sumD): Construct a prefix sum array sumD where sumD[i] is the cumulative sum of the difference array D from the start up to the i-th element.3. Range Queries: For each query, check if the sum of the segment from l to r is zero using the prefix sum array. If not, output -1.4. Range Minimum and Maximum: Use sparse tables to efficiently compute the minimum and maximum values of the prefix sum array over the segment. If any prefix sum in the segment is negative, output -1. Otherwise, the minimal number of operations required is the maximum prefix sum in the segment.

Difference Array (D): This array helps track the difference between corresponding elements of b and a.2. Prefix Sum Array (sumD): This array helps quickly determine the sum of any segment of D, which is essential to check if the sum of the segment is zero.3. Sparse Tables: These data structures allow efficient range minimum and maximum queries, which are crucial for determining the feasibility and the number of operations required.4. Query Processing: For each query, we check if the sum of the segment is zero. If not, it&#39;s impossible to balance. We then check if all prefix sums in the segment are non-negative. Finally, the maximum prefix sum gives the minimal number of operations needed.This approach ensures that each query is processed efficiently in O(1) time after preprocessing, making it suitable for large input sizes.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6c2317d8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6c2317d8><span class="icon" data-v-6c2317d8>🔑:</span></p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-a99da172><span data-v-a99da172>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 ai</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
